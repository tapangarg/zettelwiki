**Note 4: Conceptual Awareness and Its Limits**  
**Title:** The Riddle of Conceptual Awareness  
**Quote:** "If Awareness was just a functioning within existence, how is this known?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** If awareness merely operates as a function of existence, how do we come to acknowledge this operation?  
**Explanation:** The author raises a pivotal question regarding the nature of Awareness and how we recognize it. This inquiry invites us to reflect deeply on our understanding of Awareness itself and challenges assumptions that equate awareness merely to a cognitive function. It suggests an inherent contradiction: if awareness were merely functional, there should be no objective observation of it. This paradox emphasizes the need to look beyond mere functions or constructs to grasp the lived experience of Awareness. The exploration of this question can facilitate profound internal inquiry, potentially leading to deeper understandings of the self and consciousness.
