**Note 1: The Nature of Awareness and Phenomenal Perception**  
**Title:** The Intersection of Awareness and Being  
**Quote:** "we are actually bringing it to the point where the distinction between the manifest and the un-manifest starts to dissolve, to the point where the yin and the yang, they meet; where the intersection of Awareness and Being meet and are Seen to be One."  
**Translation into Modern English:** We return our attention to a state where the differences between the manifest (observable phenomena) and the un-manifest (the essence or source) begin to fade, arriving at the point where dualities, such as yin and yang, converge, revealing the unity of Awareness and Being.  

**Explanation:** This passage emphasizes the profound nature of Awareness as distinct yet interconnected to our experiences of perception. It points out the significance of recognizing that while we perceive the world through our senses (sight, hearing, taste), these perceptions require our attention and are ultimately transient. In contrast, Awareness is a more stable, underlying essence that is not contingent on our attention; it is the fundamental quality of being that exists beyond the fluctuations of our focus. This understanding helps us differentiate between the fleeting nature of sensory perception and the enduring quality of Awareness, which requires deep contemplation to fully appreciate. The recognition of unity at this intersection can lead to greater clarity in our spiritual practice and understanding of existence.

**Connections:**  
- **Duality vs. Non-Duality:** The concept of yin and yang serves as a metaphor for the dual aspects of existence which can be reconciled in a deeper understanding of non-dual awareness.  
- **Mindfulness Practice:** Cultivating mindfulness can help individuals observe the differences between attention and Awareness, enhancing spiritual growth.  
- **Transcendental Meditation:** A practice that aims to transcend ordinary thought patterns and experience pure Awareness.

**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment** by Eckhart Tolle, which explores the concepts of presence and awareness.  
- **I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj,** which delves into the nature of self and perception from a non-dual perspective.  
- **Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality** by Anthony de Mello, which discusses the nature of awareness in relation to personal growth.

**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing the distinction between transient perceptions and the essence of Awareness influence your understanding of your own existence and spiritual journey?
