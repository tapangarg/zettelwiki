**Note 2: The Inquiry of Self-Identity**  
**Title:** The Complexity of Self-Questioning  
**Quote:** "If I question myself, I am not ‘I’. And there’s no question of my existence at all."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When I pose questions about my identity, it indicates that my sense of self is not fixed, and if this essence is questioned effectively, the entire concept of my existence comes into question.  
**Explanation:** This quote encapsulates the deep philosophical inquiry into the nature of self-identity. When we investigate who we are, we often uncover that our identities are fluid and shaped by numerous factors, including thoughts, experiences, and perceptions. Ramana Maharshi's teaching here suggests a paradox—by questioning 'I', we begin to detach from our constructed identities, hinting at a deeper truth beyond the surface self. This examination is pivotal for personal growth, as it leads to self-awareness and often a more profound understanding of the essence of one's existence.  
**Connections:**
