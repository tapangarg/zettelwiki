**Note 2: Awareness of Consciousness**  
**Title:** The Aspect of Self-Awareness in Pure Consciousness  
**Quote:** "But even then we ask: ‘Is there something which is aware of even this pure Being?’"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Even in the experience of pure Being, one may question if there exists an awareness that perceives this state of existence.  
**Explanation:** The inquiry into whether there is an observer of pure Being raises profound questions about the nature of consciousness itself. The text suggests that while one experiences the essence of Being, there might also exist a higher level of awareness that observes this Being. This duality invites deep reflection on self-awareness, and the realization that consciousness itself can be both the subject and the object of observation. This principle is significant for understanding the layers of self; the observer may be independent of the observed states of consciousness, leading to questions about the true nature of identity and existence.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Observer Effect in Quantum Mechanics:** The concept that the act of observation alters the state of what is being observed, paralleling the awareness's impact on consciousness.  
- **Buddhist Concept of Anatta (Non-Self):** The notion that there is no permanent self, inviting exploration into the nature of awareness and perception.  
- **The Zen Concept of 'Beginner's Mind':** Emphasizes seeing things as they are without preconceived notions, resonating with the theme of pure awareness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Mind Illuminated:** By Culadasa (John Yates); provides insights into the exploration of consciousness through meditation.  
- **Consciousness Explained:** By Daniel Dennett; a detailed inquiry into the nature of consciousness and self-awareness.  
- **What the Buddha Taught:** By Walpola Rahula; explores the essence of awareness and consciousness in Buddhism.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does acknowledging the distinction between the observer and the observed enhance our understanding of consciousness?
