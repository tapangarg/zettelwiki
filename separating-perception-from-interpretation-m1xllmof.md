**Note 3: The Relationship between Perception and Interpretation**  
**Title:** Separating Perception from Interpretation  
**Quote:** “Therefore, if something is being believed to be a distraction, don’t push it away. Let it remain meaningless, without interpretation.”  
**Translation into Modern English:** If something is perceived as distracting, allow it to exist without labeling or interpreting it; treat it as meaningless rather than a disturbance.  
**Explanation:** The distinction between perception and interpretation is crucial for mental clarity and peace. The statement advocates for an attitude of acceptance towards distractions, urging us to refrain from labeling them as problems or interferences. This approach fosters a sense of equanimity, promoting the practice of allowing experiences to unfold without the weight of judgment or the need for meaning. By doing so, we can free ourselves from the clutter of incessant mental commentary, empowering personal growth through unbiased observation. Recognizing that our interpretations often complicate perceptions enables us to engage with the present moment authentically.
