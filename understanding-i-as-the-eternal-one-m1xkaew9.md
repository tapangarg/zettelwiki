**Note 3: The Essence of 'I'**  
**Title:** Understanding 'I' as The Eternal One  
**Quote:** "As Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi used to say ‘This I is The Eternal One’."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Ramana Maharshi teaches that our essential self, that 'I', refers to an eternal truth of existence rather than a temporary identity.  
**Explanation:** The affirmation that 'I' is The Eternal One calls attention to the timeless nature of our true self, challenging the transient identities we often indulge in. This notion posits that our core self is not a fragmented entity but an undying essence that transcends individual lifetimes and experiences. This understanding encourages followers to pursue deeper self-inquiry, leading to liberation from the confines of ego and societal definitions of identity. By identifying with the eternal aspect of ‘I’, we can cultivate a more profound connection with our existence and purpose.  
**Connections:**  
- **Spiritual Implications of 'Eternal I':** Many spiritual traditions discuss the eternal nature of the self, suggesting continuity beyond physical existence.  
- **Mystics and the Nature of Being:** Perspectives from various mystical traditions emphasize the eternal self's experience and consequences.  
- **Philosophical Discussions on Identity:** Exploration of self in existential philosophy, questioning the essence of identity in a fleeting world.
