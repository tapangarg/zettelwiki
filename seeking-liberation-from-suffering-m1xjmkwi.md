**Note 1: The Pursuit of Freedom from Suffering**  
**Title:** Seeking Liberation From Suffering  
**Quote:** "The first question, the most common question that comes is: ‘I want to be free from my suffering. How do I put an end to my suffering?’"  
**Translation into Modern English:** The primary inquiry that individuals bring to satsang is their desire to escape suffering and the question of how to achieve that liberation.  
**Explanation:** This opening inquiry reflects a profound human longing: the quest for freedom from pain and discomfort. It taps into a universal experience that many people grapple with in their lives. The speaker implies that this search for freedom is not only fundamental but perhaps the starting point for deeper spiritual inquiry. Recognizing this question paves the way for deeper understanding as it leads one to examine the mechanisms that sustain suffering and the illusions we create that bind us to such states.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Nature of Suffering in Eastern Philosophy:** Concepts from Buddhism regarding 'dukkha,' the inherent unsatisfactoriness of existence, align with the desire to end suffering.  
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** A modern psychological approach that examines the connection between thoughts and feelings, directly connecting to the claim of thoughts fueling suffering.  
- **Mindfulness and Attention:** The practice of mindfulness emphasizes awareness and attention, further linking the idea of attention as a force that can diminish or exacerbate suffering.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which explores the essence of being present as a means to transcend suffering.  
- **Radical Acceptance:** By Tara Brach, which illuminates embracing our suffering as a pathway to freedom.  
- **First Free Lecture on Buddhism:** By the Dalai Lama, which addresses the nature of desire and suffering in a spiritual context.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways do our thoughts contribute to personal suffering, and how might altering our attention help in alleviating that suffering?
