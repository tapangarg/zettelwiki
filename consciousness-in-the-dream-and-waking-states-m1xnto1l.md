**Note 2: The Dream State and Waking Reality**  
**Title:** Consciousness in the Dream and Waking States  
**Quote:** "Mind has resistance to the waking state which is nothing but the dream state."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Our mind resists accepting that what we experience in our waking lives is essentially similar to the dreams we have at night.  
**Explanation:** This passage provocatively posits that the distinction between dreaming and waking life is an illusion constructed by the mind. It underscores that both states arise from the same fundamental consciousness but are perceived differently by the mind. The notion that the waking state is resistant to recognizing this similarity invites a reflection on the nature of reality itself—could it be that our perceived “waking” experiences are, in a way, just another layer of dreams? Understanding this relationship can open avenues for exploring consciousness, as it questions the basis of what we consider ‘real’ and urges us to investigate deeper aspects of our experiences.  
**Connections:**  
- **Lucid Dreaming:** The practice of becoming aware during dreams can lead to insights about consciousness and its manipulation during both dream and waking states.  
- **Eastern Philosophical Concepts:** Ideas in Buddhism and Vedanta that emphasize the illusory nature of reality and the similarity between dream states and everyday experiences.  
- **Transpersonal Psychology:** The study of human experiences beyond the personal, encompassing thoughts about consciousness and its multifaceted nature through different states of awareness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Consciousness and the Problem of the Self** by Kevin McCormick, exploring the illusion of self in both dreaming and waking consciousness.  
- **Waking, Dreaming, Being: Mind Essays on Free Will and the Self** by Evan Thompson, which discusses the nature of consciousness in relation to the dream state.  
- **The Tibetan Book of the Dead**, which elaborates on the nature of consciousness in various states, including dreaming.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What does recognizing the dream-like nature of waking life suggest about our understanding of reality and self?
