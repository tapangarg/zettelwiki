**Note 1: The Nature of Attention and Existence**  
**Title:** The Interplay of Attention and Existence  
**Quote:** "And only that which gets my attention seems to exist. That is why this sense of existence and attention are so strongly inter-linked."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The things that I focus on are the only ones that feel real to me. This link between what I pay attention to and my sense of being is profound.  
**Explanation:** The text delves into the intimate relationship between attention and our perception of reality. It suggests that our reality only crystallizes around things that we actively attend to; in other words, without attention, the external world fades into oblivion. The assertion that "only that which gets my attention seems to exist" posits that our consciousness is selective; it shapes our reality based on where we place our focus. This insight holds great significance for personal growth, as it implies that by redirecting our attention, we could alter our perception of existence itself. Understanding this link invites deeper exploration of mindfulness and awareness practices, as they can profoundly reshape our experiences and understanding of reality.  
**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques that focus on conscious awareness which emphasize attention to the present moment can reshape our spiritual experiences and reality perception.  
- **Philosophy of Idealism:** The philosophical viewpoint that reality is mentally constructed or immaterial, paralleling the idea that existence is contingent on attention.  
- **Consciousness Studies:** Exploration of how attention affects conscious experience and reality construction in psychological and philosophical terms.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment** by Eckhart Tolle, which discusses the significance of present awareness and attention.  
- **Wherever You Go, There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life** by Jon Kabat-Zinn, an exploration of mindfulness practices that harness attention.  
- **Attention: A Complete History** by Jessica Payne, which examines how attention has been conceptualized across different disciplines.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How might consciously adjusting my attention alter my perceptions of reality and experience?
