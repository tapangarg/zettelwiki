**Note 4: The Duality of Consciousness**  
**Title:** The Dark Side of Consciousness  
**Quote:** "I jokingly say (when the audience is not new) I say ‘But even an axe-murderer is Consciousness’."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The statement illustrates that all beings, regardless of their actions, exist within the realm of Consciousness, which can embody both light and dark aspects.  
**Explanation:** This provocative statement challenges the audience to consider the moral implications of consciousness and the capacity for cruelty that exists within it. By asserting that even those who commit heinous acts are manifestations of Consciousness, it invites a deeper examination of how consciousness can express itself through vastly different means. This acknowledgment does not imply that all actions are equally valid, but rather that understanding the full spectrum of consciousness can foster compassion and a deeper inquiry into the nature of morality. The significance of this duality is profound in the context of spiritual development, as it encourages a holistic view wherein individuals must confront and integrate all aspects of their being, even those that are darker or more troubling.
