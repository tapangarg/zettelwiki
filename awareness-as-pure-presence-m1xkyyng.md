**Note 3: The Simplicity of Awareness**  
**Title:** Awareness as Pure Presence  
**Quote:** "It’s just there."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Awareness exists in its most essential form, simply as it is—unadorned and fundamental.  

**Explanation:** This statement captures the essence of awareness—its inherent simplicity and presence without complication. It suggests that awareness is not something overly complex or layered; rather, it is a fundamental aspect of our being accessible at any moment. This simplicity challenges the way we often overthink or complicate our experiences and feelings. Recognizing awareness as ‘just there’ emphasizes that one does not need elaborate theories or complex spiritual practices to access it. This clarity can be liberating, allowing individuals to return to their present experience without being burdened by the expectations or narratives typically constructed around consciousness.  

**Connections:**  
- **Presence in Mindfulness:** The focus on being present in the moment and recognizing the simplicity of experience is a core principle of mindfulness practices.  
- **Simplicity and Zen Philosophy:** The Zen approach often emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and the unadorned nature of reality as a reflection of conscious awareness.  
- **Transcendental Awareness in Eastern Traditions:** Many Eastern philosophies discuss a similar idea of recognizing a bare, unmediated awareness that underlies all thoughts and experiences.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **Wherever You Go, There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life** by Jon Kabat-Zinn, which introduces mindfulness and awareness in a practical context.  
- **The Zen Teaching of Bodhidharma** which provides insight into the simplicity of awareness in Zen Buddhism.  
- **The Relaxation Response** by Herbert Benson, which explores how simply being in the moment can lead to profound relaxation and awareness.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How can returning to the simple recognition of awareness transform your daily experiences and interactions with the world?
