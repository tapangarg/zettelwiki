**Note 2: Seeking Divine Presence**  
**Title:** The Question of Divine Existence  
**Quote:** "Then, you say: ‘Yes. I have lost my ability to suffer. All thoughts are just coming and going. I’m not resisting anything at all. So, I have lost my ability to suffer, but can you show me God?’"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Upon realizing that you can let go of suffering, you inquire if divine presence can be witnessed.  
**Explanation:** This segment prompts a profound exploration of spiritual existence and the quest for divine connection. It highlights that even in moments of clarity and freedom from suffering, the human longing for a tangible understanding of God or a higher power persists. The juxtaposition between the loss of suffering and the desire to connect with divinity raises critical questions about the nature of belief and experience. Many spiritual traditions assert that divinity exists inherent in existence itself—one does not need to look externally for God, as the essence of being can unveil this presence.   
**Connections:**  
- **Existential Philosophy:** Explores the nature of existence, consciousness, and the divine, providing insights into the human quest for meaning.  
- **Mystical Experiences Across Traditions:** Many spiritual paths, including Sufism and Christian mysticism, discuss the direct experience of God or the sacred.  
- **Interfaith Dialogues:** Various religious traditions often approach the question of God and presence differently, leading to richer understandings of divinity.  
**Further Reading:**

- **"The Cloud of Unknowing" (Anonymous):** An essential classic that interlinks contemplation and the pursuit of divine understanding.  
- **"Siddhartha" by Hermann Hesse:** A novel exploring spiritual enlightenment and the quest for understanding and connection with the divine.
