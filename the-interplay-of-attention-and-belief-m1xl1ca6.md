**Note 1: The Relationship Between Attention and Belief**  
**Title:** The Interplay of Attention and Belief  
**Quote:** "What we have done is we have divested our belief. And with the divestment of belief, you find that attention is also not so attracted to these thoughts."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When we lessen our belief in certain thoughts or experiences, our attention naturally drifts away from those thoughts. Essentially, by withdrawing our belief, we reduce the mental energy we invest in them.  

**Explanation:** In this statement, the speaker highlights a profound connection between our beliefs and where we direct our attention. When we hold strong beliefs about specific ideas, events, or feelings, they tend to capture our attention intensely. However, if we consciously choose to divest ourselves of such beliefs—essentially letting them go—our attention can also detach from these thoughts. This process allows us to experience a clearer sense of self apart from those thoughts. Such a realization may lead us to understand that our identity and experience need not be tethered to our mental constructs. This freedom marks a significant spiritual awakening, one where our presence resembles that of a Sage, demonstrating that our essence is fundamentally unchanged irrespective of the ceaseless flow of thoughts.  

**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness and Non-Attachment:** The practice of observing thoughts without attachment is central to mindfulness techniques, which foster a greater awareness of mental processes.  
- **The Teachings of Advaita Vedanta:** This philosophical school emphasizes the non-duality of self and reality, articulating that fundamentally, we are one with the divine.  
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** A therapeutic approach that explores the relationship between beliefs, thoughts, and emotions, promoting the idea that modifying beliefs can influence attention and overall mental well-being.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which discusses living in the present moment and detaching from thoughts and beliefs.  
- **Be Here Now:** By Ram Dass, a spiritual classic that emphasizes presence and awareness, akin to a Sage’s perspective.  
- **Siddhartha:** By Hermann Hesse, which explores the journey of self-discovery and the understanding of one's true essence.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How might letting go of limiting beliefs change your experience of your own thoughts and identity?
