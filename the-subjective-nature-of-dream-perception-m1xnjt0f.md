**Note 2: The Experience of Identity in Dreams**  
**Title:** The Subjective Nature of Dream Perception  
**Quote:** "I see so many faces, so many people around, but the ‘I Am-ness’, the sense of aliveness, is felt only on that particular dream body."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Throughout the dream, while I may encounter various characters and scenarios, the feeling of being alive and my core identity stems exclusively from my dream self.  
**Explanation:** This statement highlights a fascinating layer of the dreaming experience – the realization that while numerous characters populate our dreams, the subjective experience of 'I Am-ness' is exclusively associated with our dream persona. It reveals the essence of self-awareness in dreams and indicates how perception is inherently individualistic. In dreams, the dreamer finds an autonomous existence separate from others despite the presence of multiple entities. This observation is significant as it prompts deeper questions about our concrete identity in waking life and challenges the fallacy that our experiences rely heavily on external validation. Understanding how our perceptions shape our sense of self both in dreaming and waking life is crucial to fostering a more nuanced comprehension of human consciousness.
