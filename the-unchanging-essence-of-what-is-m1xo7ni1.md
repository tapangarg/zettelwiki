**Note 1: The Nature of Existence**  
**Title:** The Unchanging Essence of What Is  
**Quote:** "What IS, just IS."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The essence of existence is constant and unchanging; it does not go through the cycles of coming and going.  
**Explanation:** The text emphasizes the notion that the fundamental nature of reality transcends our conventional understanding of time and change. It presents the concept of an underlying awareness or consciousness that remains unaffected by external events. This realization encourages a perspective shift, urging individuals to cultivate awareness of this unchanging essence within themselves amid the dynamic experiences of life. Recognizing that "What IS" is eternal allows us to detach from the transient aspects of our lives and align ourselves with a deeper truth, fostering peace and stability in the face of fluctuation and uncertainty.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Concept of Atman in Advaita Vedanta:** The belief that our true Self (Atman) is eternal and unchanging, akin to this notion of “What IS.”  
- **Buddhism’s Concept of Emptiness (Śūnyatā):** The understanding that all phenomena are transient and that clinging to them causes suffering—aligning with the teaching that everything comes and goes while the essence remains.  
- **Non-Dualism:** The idea that there is no separation between the observer and the observed, which resonates with the message of unity in existence.    
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That:** By Nisargadatta Maharaj, which explores the nature of consciousness and non-duality.  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, focusing on mindfulness and being present in the moment as a way to experience the essence of existence.  
- **Being and Time:** By Martin Heidegger, which addresses the fundamental questions of existence and the nature of being.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can recognizing the unchanging essence of reality influence your approach to life's challenges and transitions?
