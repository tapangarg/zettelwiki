**Note 3: The Confusion of Self and Awareness**  
**Title:** Distinguishing Between Awareness and the Transient Self  
**Quote:** “A: Okay, which of these two now? Q: Awareness, and the one which keeps coming and going.”  
**Translation into Modern English:** The speaker asks for clarification between the stable state of Awareness and the identity that experiences change and fluctuation.  
**Explanation:** This exchange highlights the confusion many face in distinguishing between true Awareness and the egoic self, which is subject to change. The inquiry implies a deeper recognition that many individuals may mistakenly equate the transient emotions, thoughts, and identities with their core self or Awareness. Clarifying this distinction remains pivotal in many spiritual practices, as it allows individuals to transcend attachments to the fluctuating aspects of their being, leading to deeper understanding and liberation from suffering. Recognizing this dichotomy can ultimately lead to more profound psychological and spiritual growth.  
**Connections:**  
- **Carl Jung’s Concepts of Persona and Shadow:** Explores the false self (persona) and the deeper self, paralleling the confusion between Awareness and the transient self.  
- **Vedanta Philosophy:** Focuses on the difference between the Atman (true self) and the lower self grounded in the illusion of separateness.  
- **The Four Noble Truths in Buddhism:** Teach about understanding the nature of suffering, desire, and ultimately recognizing the nature of self.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself** by Michael A. Singer, focusing on the exploration of the self beyond thought and identity.  
- **Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism** by Chögyam Trungpa, addressing the confusion that arises in spirituality about identity and Awareness.  
- **The Tao of Pooh** by Benjamin Hoff, which uses the characters of Winnie the Pooh to discuss concepts of simplicity, Awareness, and the ego.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing the difference between our true Awareness and our transient identities alter the way we experience everyday life?
