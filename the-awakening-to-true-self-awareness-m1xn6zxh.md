**Note 1: Reinterpreting the 'I' in Advaita**  
**Title:** The Awakening to True Self-Awareness  
**Quote:** "But, it is ‘I’ which is Aware. Just it’s not this ‘I’ which we’ve been using ‘I’ for in the past."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The genuine 'I' refers to the aspect of consciousness that is aware, but this awareness isn't tied to the identity we've previously defined as 'I'.  
**Explanation:** This segment delves into the significance of understanding the concept of 'I' within Advaita Vedanta. Traditionally, the 'I' has been associated with the ego and the body-mind complex. The speaker suggests that in Advaita, the aim is to shift the understanding of 'I' from an egoic identity towards recognizing it as the true Self—pure, unbounded awareness. This shift is essential for spiritual growth, as it allows one to transcend the limitations and attachments associated with the ego, moving towards a more profound and liberating understanding of existence. The essence of this teaching is to recognize that real awareness is free of attributes and that mislabeling the 'I' as merely the ego can lead to spiritual arrogance.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Concept of 'Atman' in Hindu Philosophy:** Understanding ‘Atman’ as the true self can help bridge the interpretations of the 'I.'  
- **Buddhism's No-Self (Anatta):** Exploring the differences and similarities between the self-concepts in Buddhism and Advaita provides a richer philosophical dialogue on identity.  
- **The Role of Awareness in Meditation:** Awareness as a focal point in meditative practices emphasizes the importance of understanding the 'I' to cultivate deeper states of consciousness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Introduction** by Chandrashekarendra Saraswati, which outlines the core tenets of Advaita philosophy.  
- **The Heart of the Buddha’s Teaching** by Thich Nhat Hanh, a comprehensive exploration of Buddhist teachings including the concept of No-Self.  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, a key text exploring the nature of 'I' in a direct manner.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can recognizing the distinction between the ego and true awareness reshape your interactions with yourself and the world around you?
