Note 3: The Symbolic Journey of Mary of Egypt

**Title:** The Symbolic Journey and Influence of Mary of Egypt 

**Quote:** "In John Berryman's Pulitzer Prize winning book of poetry, The Dream Songs, poem 47, subtitled 'April Fool's Day, or, St. Mary of Egypt,' recounts Mary of Egypt's walk across the River Jordan."

**Translation into Modern English:** John Berryman, in his renowned poetry collection "The Dream Songs," dedicates a poem to the moment when Mary of Egypt crosses the River Jordan, celebrating her spiritual journey.

**Explanation:** Mary of Egypt's crossing of the River Jordan serves as a rich symbolism of transformation and spiritual trial. Berryman's poetic interpretation underscores the metaphysical undercurrents in her story, using her journey as a metaphorical expression of overcoming life's adversities and searching for deeper spiritual fulfillment. This allusion reinforces Mary's place in literature as an archetype for personal redemption and the quest for divine grace.

**Connections:**
