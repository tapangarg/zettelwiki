**Note 1: The Indescribable 'I'**  
**Title:** The Unfindable Essence of Self  
**Quote:** "So, this ‘I’ which is indescribable..., and yet it is so clear, that It Is. We cannot deny the existence of this ‘I’. We can only say that it is not to be found phenomenally."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The essence of the self, while difficult to describe in concrete terms, is undeniable in its presence. However, this essence cannot be located or defined through observable phenomena.  
**Explanation:** In this passage, the speaker highlights a foundational concept in spiritual inquiry: the distinction between the existential essence of 'I' and the transient nature of thoughts and feelings. This 'I' encompasses the awareness of one's existence, often thought to be hidden behind layers of personal identity, thoughts, emotions, and perceptions. It is a profound observation that while we possess a strong sense of our existence ('I'), the true nature of this self cannot be pinned down through sensory experiences or mental constructs. This realization opens avenues for deeper self-exploration and can lead to greater understanding and spiritual growth. Recognizing that the essence of self remains constant despite the fluctuations of feelings and thoughts invites a shift in perspective, encouraging individuals to explore beyond their identifications and delusions of self.  
**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness and Presence:** The practice of mindfulness emphasizes awareness of thoughts and feelings without attachment, similar to how the 'I' in this context remains untouched by them.  
- **Existential Philosophy:** Philosophers such as René Descartes (Cogito, ergo sum) explore similar themes about the nature of self and existence, engaging in deeper questions about consciousness.  
- **Non-Duality:** Teachings in non-dual philosophies explore the idea that the separative self is an illusion and that true identity transcends personal attributes.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"Being Aware of Being Aware" by Rupert Spira:** This book explores the nature of consciousness and awareness, emphasizing the transcendent qualities of the self.  
- **"The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle:** This work discusses mindfulness and presence, delving into the realization of self beyond thoughts and feelings.  
- **"I Am That" by Nisargadatta Maharaj:** In this classic work, concepts of self-awareness and the illusion of personal identity are dissected, offering profound insights into non-duality.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways do our thoughts and feelings shape our understanding of self, and how can recognizing the unchanging essence of 'I' influence our approach to life's challenges?
