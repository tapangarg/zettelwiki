**Note 4: The Unchanging ‘I’ in the Play of Existence**  
**Title:** Recognizing the Eternal ‘I’ Amidst the Illusion of Change  
**Quote:** “Even in the playing of ‘I’ as ‘I Am’, ‘I’ has remained as ‘I’.”  
**Translation into Modern English:** Throughout the experience and manifestations of ‘I’ as ‘I Am’, the fundamental self, ‘I’, remains unchanged.  
**Explanation:** This idea emphasizes the distinction between our transient experiences and the true, unchanging self. While we may play roles, identify with different aspects of our existence, and immerse ourselves in various experiences, the essence of ‘I’—the true self—remains constant and unaltered. This understanding is crucial in navigating life; the recognition that our true identity is not tied to our experiences or roles helps alleviate suffering generated by attachment and identification with the temporary. By affirming that the ‘I’ persists beyond the changes and the play of existence, we cultivate a sense of inner peace and stability—knowing we are not merely defined by external conditions or fleeting moods.  
**Connections:**  
- **Transience of Identity:** Philosophies that discuss how identity is shaped and changed by experience versus the eternal self.  
- **Existential Philosophy:** Engagement with the nature of existence and the self.  
- **Buddhist Concepts of Anatta:** The idea of non-self, illustrating the difference between self and the experiences that arise.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Tao of Pooh:** By Benjamin Hoff, which demonstrates how simplicity and awareness can lead to understanding the self.  
- **Siddhartha:** By Hermann Hesse, which illustrates the journey of self-discovery against the backdrop of transitory experiences.  
- **Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind:** By Shunryu Suzuki, exploring Zen principles surrounding self and awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can recognizing the eternal ‘I’ reshape your approach to the roles and identities you adopt in everyday life?
