**Note 1: The Transformation of Perspective on Death**  
**Title:** From Fear to Faith: A Child's Growing Understanding of Death  
**Quote:** "As a four-year-old child who had just lost her mother, the coffin ‘appeared large and dismal’. In contrast, as an adult, who had ‘grown up . . . the coffin appeared smaller . . . [and now, the reality of death, seen through faith, was an occasion] to contemplate heaven.’"  
**Translation into Modern English:** As a young child mourning her mother, Thérèse found the coffin to represent an enormous and depressing reality. In adulthood, however, her perspective had shifted; she viewed the coffin as less intimidating, allowing her to reflect on heavenly existence through her faith.  
**Explanation:** Thérèse's reflection illustrates how loss shapes our perception of life and death. Her experiences reveal a shift from the overwhelming fear and sorrow of childhood to a mature acceptance and hopeful contemplation brought about by her faith. This growth underscores the significance of developing a spiritual framework for understanding the experiences of life, especially loss.
