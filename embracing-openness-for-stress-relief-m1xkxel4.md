**Note 2: The Importance of Openness**  
**Title:** Embracing Openness for Stress Relief  
**Quote:** "This is how to be tension free; if you allow your attention free."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Allowing your attention to flow freely leads to a state of relaxation and release from tension.  

**Explanation:** The ability to maintain an open attitude is crucial for personal growth and emotional well-being. When we allow our attention to flow instead of being fixated on certain thoughts or outcomes, we create space for clarity and insight. This state of openness encourages a relaxed mindset, making it easier to navigate life's complexities. It's about shifting from a mindset that is solely focused on achievement and control to one that embraces the natural unfolding of experiences. The phrase "allow your attention free" embodies the essence of relinquishing control, which is often the root cause of tension and anxiety.
