**Note 1: The Power of the Mind and the Master’s Experience**  
**Title:** The Transition of the Mind's Power in Spiritual Awakening  
**Quote:** "For the Master, it just happened that the mind, which seemed to have so much power earlier now seems to have no power; or has only .0001 percent of the power it used to have, so it cannot push you into this pretense anymore."  
**Translation into Modern English:** For the Master, the strong influence that the mind once held has diminished significantly. It has become almost nonexistent, to the extent that it can no longer compel him to engage in pretense or illusion.  
**Explanation:** This statement illustrates a profound transformation in the Mind of the Master compared to ordinary experiences of thought. The Master has cultivated an awareness that diminishes the mind's controlling influence, leading to a state of authenticity and presence. The significance of this lies in understanding that such an awakening does not place the Master in a higher or alternative state—it's a realization of their inherent nature. In this process, thoughts are acknowledged as transient and no longer hold power over the perceived Self, allowing for a deeper experience of truth without the clutches of illusion. The lesson lies in recognizing that the mastery over thought is a possibility for anyone willing to navigate the path of self-awareness.  
**Connections:**  
- **Ego Transcendence:** The diminishment of the mind aligns with teachings on transcending the ego, as highlighted in various spiritual traditions.  
- **The Role of Meditation:** Practices that cultivate awareness (e.g., meditation) play a significant role in achieving similar mastery over thoughts and feelings.  
- **Authenticity and Presence:** This relates to the exploration of personal authenticity and presence that is emphasized in modern psychological approaches such as Mindfulness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which discusses the importance of living in the present moment and the fleeting nature of thoughts.  
- **A New Earth:** Also by Eckhart Tolle, which delves into the concepts of ego and enlightenment, emphasizing the dissolution of mental power.  
- **Being Aware of Being Aware:** By Anthony de Mello, which explores consciousness and the power of self-awareness in spiritual development.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does the recognition of the mind's transient nature affect your daily experiences and interactions with the world around you?
