**Note 1: The Inevitable Recognition of the Self**  
**Title:** Returning Home to the True Self  
**Quote:** "it is inevitable, this recognition of the Self, this coming home."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Recognizing one’s true Self and returning to it is unavoidable. This process is akin to returning home, suggesting that the essence of who we are is always present, waiting to be acknowledged.  
**Explanation:** The journey to self-discovery is framed as both necessary and inevitable, implying that while we may feel lost or disconnected at times, our true nature and identity have never actually strayed from us. This realization invites a sense of comfort and ease, suggesting that all efforts to seek the Self are, in truth, a reunion with our inherent nature. It encourages us to embrace the journey, even when it feels challenging, because our true essence is always present.  
**Connections:**  
- ** Non-Duality:** The concept that separation is an illusion, and understanding one’s true Self is key to spiritual liberation.  
- **Homecoming in Spiritual Traditions:** Many spiritual paths emphasize the return to one's true nature, often referred to as home, unity, or oneness with the Divine.  
- **The Role of the Guru in Spiritual Awakening:** Emphasizes guidance on this journey towards self-recognition and truths that have always existed within us.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which explores presence and inner awareness.  
- **I Am That:** By Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, which discusses the recognition of true Self in non-dual philosophy.  
- **The Wisdom of Insecurity:** By Alan Watts, touching on the inevitable quest for self and security in a changing world.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What practices can help facilitate the recognition of the true Self, and how can we allow this inherent truth to guide our behavior and choices in life?
