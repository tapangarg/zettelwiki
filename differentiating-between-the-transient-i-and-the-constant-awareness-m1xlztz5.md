**Note 1: The Nature of 'I' and Awareness**  
**Title:** Differentiating Between the Transient 'I' and the Constant Awareness  
**Quote:** "Ah, okay, so if ‘I’ is coming and going, who is aware of the coming and going of this ‘I’?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** If the sense of self you refer to as 'I' experiences fluctuations, then who is the observer that witnesses these fluctuations?  

**Explanation:** This dialogue reveals a fundamental aspect of self-awareness. The speaker challenges the idea of a static 'I' by pointing out that this identity is subject to change, while something else—awareness—remains constant. The inquiry implies that our familiar sense of self ('I') is transient, shifting with experiences and thoughts, whereas awareness serves as a stable witness to these changes. This distinction is significant for growth, as recognizing the separation can lead to deeper self-understanding and a more profound realization of our true nature, which is not limited to the ego or fluctuating identity. 

**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality:** This concept aligns with non-dual philosophies that highlight the distinction between the observer (Awareness) and the observed (the transient self).  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques that focus on observing thoughts and feelings can create an awareness that separates the self from its experiences, emphasizing the role of observer vs. observed.  
- **Buddhist Anatta (Non-Self):** This principle teaches that clinging to a permanent self leads to suffering, underscoring the importance of recognizing impermanence.

**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now** by Eckhart Tolle, which discusses consciousness and the nature of self in present awareness.  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, which addresses non-duality and the distinction between self and awareness.  
- **Mindfulness in Plain English** by Bhante Henepola Gunaratana, focusing on the practice of mindfulness and the separation of thought and awareness.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing the constant aspect of Awareness shift your perception of self and influence your interactions with the world around you?
