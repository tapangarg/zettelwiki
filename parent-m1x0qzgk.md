He captured what he had experienced that morning in his poem “Composed Upon Westminster Bridge, Sept. 3, 1803.” Earth has not any thing to show more fair; 
Dull would be he of soul who could pass by 
A sight so touching in its majesty. 
This city now doth like a garment wear 
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare, 
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie 
Open unto the fields, and to the sky, 
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air. 
Never did sun more beautifully steep 
In his first splendour valley, rock, or hill; 
Ne’er say I, never felt, a calm so deep! 
The river glideth at his own sweet will; 
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep, 
And all that mighty heart is lying still!11
