**Note 3: The Illusion of Identity**  
**Title:** The Question of 'I' Beyond the Body  
**Quote:** "So, this ‘I’ is not the body? Because body changed."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The sense of self or 'I' persists independently of the physical body, as the body itself may change over time or in different contexts.  
**Explanation:** This inquiry into what constitutes the 'I' raises important philosophical questions about identity. By highlighting that our sense of self can often be mistakenly linked to the physical body, the text provokes thought about the essence of who we are. If the body is transient and undergoes changes, then the question of our true nature becomes significant. The concept of a persistent consciousness that exists beyond the physical realm prompts deeper introspection on the meaning of self and identity, sparking a journey of inner exploration that is crucial for personal development.  
**Connections:**

- **Existential Philosophy:** The exploration of meaning and existence raises questions about identity, being, and non-being, relevant to this concept of self.

- **Being and Time:** By Martin Heidegger, discussing the nature of being and self-exploration beyond physical attributes.  
- **The Self Illusion:** By Bruce Hood, exploring how science reveals that the self is more a narrative than a tangible entity.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing that 'I' is not limited to the body inform your understanding of personal identity across various life experiences?
