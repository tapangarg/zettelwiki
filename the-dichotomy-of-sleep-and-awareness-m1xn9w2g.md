**Note 1: Awareness and the Nature of Sleep**  
**Title:** The Dichotomy of Sleep and Awareness  
**Quote:** "There is a Knowing-ness or an Awareness that there was nothing; no phenomena, no phenomenal experience including that which we call ‘Being’ or ‘I Am’."  
**Translation into Modern English:** There exists a kind of awareness that recognizes the absence of any experience during sleep; there's simply nothing to report about that state of being.  
**Explanation:** The passage begins with a philosophical reflection on the peculiar nature of sleep, particularly the experience of being in a state where there’s no conscious awareness. The concept that even in sleep, one has an underlying awareness demonstrates the complexity of consciousness itself. This ‘Knowing-ness’ suggests that even in moments void of experiences, there remains a foundation of awareness that is distinctly separate from the contents of consciousness. This idea has profound implications for understanding self-identity, consciousness, and the experience of reality itself. It highlights a key aspect of human experience—our ability to perceive and recognize absence as part of the continuum of awareness and existence, which is a hallmark of deeper philosophical inquiry into the nature of being.  
**Connections:**  
- **Nonduality:** The teachings around nonduality emphasize that there is an awareness that transcends both waking and sleeping states, suggesting a continuous consciousness regardless of perceived reality.  
- **Mindfulness:** The practice of mindfulness often revolves around maintaining awareness of the present moment, which includes recognizing the subtle states of our mind, whether it is active or still, such as during sleep.  
- **Phenomenology:** This branch of philosophy examines structures of consciousness and experience, and this discussion aligns with phenomenological explorations of awareness and existence.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Being Aware of Being Aware:** By John Buchan, which delves into various states of consciousness and awareness.  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, where the author discusses consciousness beyond physical states and invites readers to explore their own awareness.  
- **The Tao of Pooh:** By Benjamin Hoff, which explores consciousness and simplicity through the lens of Eastern philosophies.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does the recognition of a constant awareness influence our understanding of identity, existence, and the nature of our experiences?
