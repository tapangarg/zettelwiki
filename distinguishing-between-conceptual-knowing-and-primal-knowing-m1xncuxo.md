**Note 1: The Essence of Primal Knowing**  
**Title:** Distinguishing Between Conceptual Knowing and Primal Knowing  
**Quote:** "when I am speaking of Knowing right now, I am not talking about the conceptual or mental knowing... This Knowing is the primal Knowing which is synonymous with Awareness itself."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When I refer to 'Knowing', I’m not talking about knowledge acquired through concepts or thoughts. Instead, I’m highlighting a primal form of Knowing that aligns with Awareness itself.  
**Explanation:** The speaker underscores a crucial distinction in understanding human consciousness: the difference between mental, conceptual knowing and the deeper, intrinsic Knowing that is often overlooked. The latter is fundamental, transcending intellectual comprehension, and is deeply intertwined with the notion of Awareness. This type of Knowing goes beyond labels and categorizations, offering a direct experience of being that can lead to a more profound understanding of the self and existence. Recognizing the distinction between these forms of Knowing can be transformative on the spiritual journey. It allows practitioners to move away from reliance on intellectual constructs and toward experiencing life more fully in the moment, fostering a true sense of presence and being.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Dual Awareness:** The concept that there is an underlying unified reality beyond dualistic perceptions is closely related to primal Knowing.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** These emphasize direct experience of the present moment, aligning with the idea of primal Knowing.  
- **Eastern Philosophies:** Many schools of thought, such as Advaita Vedanta, explore the essence of true Knowing and Awareness as foundational aspects of existence.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment** by Eckhart Tolle, focusing on living in the present moment as a gateway to deeper understanding.  
- **I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj**, which explores non-duality and the nature of reality beyond conceptions.  
- **Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality** by Anthony de Mello, which highlights the importance of understanding deeper consciousness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can distinguishing between conceptual knowing and primal knowing deepen our spiritual practice and understanding of self-awareness?
