**Note 2: The Experience of Deep Sleep**  
**Title:** The Absence of 'I' in Deep Sleep  
**Quote:** "In deep sleep? Yes. Yes."  
**Translation into Modern English:** In the state of deep sleep, there is an absence of 'I' or personal identity.  

**Explanation:** This segment examines deep sleep as a unique state of consciousness where the typical sense of 'I' or personal identity is absent. During such states, individuals enter a realm where their thoughts, worries, and self-referential narratives dissolve. This absence prompts a reflection on the nature of consciousness: if ‘I’ is not present in deep sleep, what truly defines our existence? This challenges the notion that identity is inherent; rather, it suggests that identity might be a construct formed through waking experiences.

**Connections:**  
- **States of Consciousness in Psychology:** Psychological studies on sleep and consciousness elucidate the importance of different states, including the transition between wakefulness and sleep.  
- **Mindfulness and Sleep:** Practices that promote awareness during rest can enhance our understanding of consciousness and self-awareness.  
- **Dream Analysis:** Techniques like Jungian dream analysis examine the significance of the unconscious mind, which shares a delicate relationship with states of deep sleep.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams** by Matthew Walker, which discusses the science of sleep and consciousness.  
- **The Interpretation of Dreams** by Sigmund Freud, focusing on the unconscious mind's role in shaping consciousness.  
- **Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion** by Sam Harris, exploring consciousness beyond traditional religious frameworks.  

**Question for Contemplation:** What insights can you derive about your consciousness and self-identity from your experiences of deep sleep, and how might this inform your waking life?
