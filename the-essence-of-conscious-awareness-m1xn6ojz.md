**Note 3: The Nature of Awareness**  
**Title:** The Essence of Conscious Awareness  
**Quote:** "the fact is that This that is Aware is ‘I’. It’s just that we’ve been mis-using ‘I’."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Ultimately, the true essence of awareness can be identified with the 'I', but we have often misinterpreted or misapplied this sense of self.  

**Explanation:** This statement emphasizes the inherent connection between awareness and our sense of self. It suggests that while the aspect of 'I' exists, it has been distorted through identification and ego attachments. This has significant implications for spiritual practice, as recognizing the true nature of awareness offers the potential for transformative clarity, allowing individuals to perceive themselves and the world with deeper insight and understanding.

**Question for Contemplation:** How does your understanding of awareness as a true 'I' influence your perception of reality, self, and your interactions with the world?
