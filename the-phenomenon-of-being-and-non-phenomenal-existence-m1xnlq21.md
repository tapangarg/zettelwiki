**Note 2: The Essence of Being**  
**Title:** The Phenomenon of Being and Non-Phenomenal Existence  
**Quote:** "This sense of Being, the sense of existence, is also born with the non-phenomenal where even the sense of existence cannot be found."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The perception of existence is inherently linked to an aspect of reality that transcends phenomena, where even the idea of existence itself becomes elusive or ungraspable.  
**Explanation:** This idea delves into the intricate relationship between our sense of existence (Being) and the aspect of reality that exists beyond our perceptions (the non-phenomenal). It encourages a contemplative exploration into the nature of consciousness, prompting us to acknowledge that our understanding of existence is limited to what can be perceived, yet there exists a deeper, unfathomable layer that remains outside our sensory and conceptual grasp. This insight invites practitioners to explore the tension between knowing and unknowing, emphasizing that true understanding requires the gentle relinquishment of our mental constructs and concepts surrounding existence. Embracing this perspective can be transformative; it fosters a deeper connection to the fabric of reality that lies beyond the confines of thought and perception, leading to a richer life experience.  
**Connections:**  
- **Zen Buddhism:** The notion of "emptiness" (śūnyatā) aligns with the idea that ultimate reality transcends our conceptual frameworks.  
- **Existential Philosophy:** The focus on existence and the inherent challenges posed by phenomena emphasizes the search for authenticity and meaning beyond surface-level understanding.  
- **Transpersonal Psychology:** This field examines spiritual gifts of consciousness that emerge when individuals connect with that which transcends the ordinary sense of self.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which outlines the importance of being present to the essence of existence beyond thought.  
- **The Tao Te Ching:** By Lao Tzu, which encapsulates the essence of existence and thought while promoting an understanding that surpasses dualities and phenomena.  
- **Being and Time:** By Martin Heidegger, which explores the structure of Being and existence in a philosophical context.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can the exploration of the non-phenomenal aspects of existence shift our understanding of ourselves and the universe around us?
