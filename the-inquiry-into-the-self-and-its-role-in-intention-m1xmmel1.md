**Note 3: The Illusion of the Self in Intention**  
**Title:** The Inquiry into the Self and Its Role in Intention  
**Quote:** "when we come to the inquiry to see that there is nobody."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Through deep inquiry, we may come to understand that the concept of a separate self is an illusion.  
**Explanation:** The notion that "there is nobody" challenges the foundational belief in a separate self that acts upon intentions. It suggests that upon deep investigation, the idea of a distinct self — which perceives and pursues individual intentions — may dissolve, leading to profound insights about the interconnectedness of existence. When individuals recognize this illusion, it allows them to engage with life not from a place of separation but from a unified perspective. This understanding can liberate one from the constraints of personal motivation and goals, facilitating a deeper connection with the flow of life and a greater openness to experience.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality:** A philosophical and spiritual understanding that emphasizes the oneness of all existence, undermining the idea of a separate self.  
- **The Concept of Anatta in Buddhism:** The teaching of "non-self," which posits that the self is a collection of experiences rather than a permanent entity.  
- **The Enneagram’s Exploration of the Ego:** In psychology, the Enneagram explores the facets of the self and how they can limit personal growth and distort intentions.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Book of Not Knowing:** By Peter Ralston, which offers insights into the nature of self and consciousness.  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, emphasizing living in the present moment and overcoming the ego.  
- **I Am That:** By Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, a classic work in non-dual philosophy that delves deeply into the self and reality.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing the illusory nature of the self change the way I approach intentions and my overall perspective on life?
