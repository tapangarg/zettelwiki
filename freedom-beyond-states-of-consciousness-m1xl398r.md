**Note 3: The Experience of Freedom**  
**Title:** Freedom Beyond States of Consciousness  
**Quote:** "In sleep state, does somebody want freedom? No."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When in the state of sleep, there is no desire for freedom or experience, as the conscious mind is inactive.  

**Explanation:** This statement draws attention to the nature of desires and experiences in different states of mind. In the sleep state, the individual lacks awareness and desire; hence, Freedom is an irrelevant concept during this state. However, in the states of waking and dreaming, the notion of freedom arises as individuals navigate their experiences. This profound realization suggests that the quest for freedom may be tied to our states of awareness and consciousness and hints at deeper levels of freedom that may exist beyond conditioned experiences.

**Connections:**  
- **The Nature of Desire:** Understanding how desire operates within different states of consciousness can lead to liberation from attachment and suffering.  
- **Yoga Philosophy**: The concept of Moksha or liberation in yoga traditions emphasizes transcending states of consciousness to experience true freedom.  
- **Existentialism:** The exploration of freedom and meaning within conscious human experience can yield valuable insights into the human condition.  

**Further Reading:**   
- **Freedom from the Known:** By Jiddu Krishnamurti, which discusses liberation from conditioned thought.  
- **Being and Nothingness:** By Jean-Paul Sartre, examining freedom and the human experience.  
- **The Wisdom of Insecurity:** By Alan Watts, focusing on the interrelation of freedom and the human experience.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How does our understanding of freedom change when we recognize the conditions of our states of awareness and consciousness?
