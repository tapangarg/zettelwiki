**Note 3: Overcoming Illusions in Spiritual Practice**  
**Title:** The Thorn of Advaita: Navigating Spiritual Illusions  
**Quote:** "Advaita is the best thorn to remove other thorns, but if Advaita itself gets embedded as a thorn then who will remove this thorn?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** While the understanding of non-duality can help eliminate other spiritual obstacles, it can also become a hindrance if one becomes too attached to that understanding.  

**Explanation:** The analogy of "thorns" depicts both the challenges and tools within the spiritual journey. Advaita, representing profound insights into non-duality, serves as a clarifying tool to help practitioners unravel various misconceptions. However, if this realization leads to attachment or self-righteousness—where one begins to see themselves as superior due to their understanding of non-duality—it can cause further entrapment in spiritual ego. The value of humility, continued self-examination, and openness to further learning is paramount, as these prevent any single understanding from becoming an obstacle in one’s journey toward true enlightenment. Recognizing that even the most revered spiritual insights can present pitfalls is an essential aspect of maturity in any spiritual practice.
