**Note 1: The Reliance on Self-Assessment in Spiritual Journeys**

**Title:** The Role of Self-Check in Spiritual Progress

**Quote:** "there comes a point where this one is the most dominant aspect of the seeker. The one that is checking and reporting on spiritual progress is what the seeker relies on for sustenance for very, very long."

**Translation into Modern English:** At some stage, the aspect of the seeker that constantly evaluates and reports on their spiritual progress becomes the predominant focus, serving as a crucial source of motivation and sustenance for an extended period.

**Explanation:** This notion emphasizes how individuals on a spiritual journey often cling to the self-assessment of their progress as a primary means of understanding and navigating their spiritual path. The internal "checker" becomes a significant feature that allows seekers to gauge their spiritual health, providing them with a sense of security and motivation. However, the dependency on this assessment can also become limiting, as it may lead to distractions or misconceptions about true spiritual growth. It’s imperative to recognize that continuous checking may generate anxiety or dissatisfaction if progress is perceived to be lacking. Thus, one must learn to move beyond this instinctual reliance and embrace a more profound self-inquiry free from judgment.

**Connections:** 
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques that encourage present-moment awareness can mitigate constant self-checking and foster a more profound understanding of one's spiritual state.
- **Spiritual Bypassing:** The tendency to avoid genuine spiritual inquiry through superficial self-analysis, highlighting how reliance on one’s personal assessments might obstruct deeper growth.
- **Non-Dual Awareness:** The exploration of questions like "Who am I?" connects to non-dual teachings, emphasizing the importance of recognizing one's true essence beyond the spiritual ego.

**Further Reading:** 
- **Returning to the Heart: A Guide to Spiritual Awakening** by Stephen C. Paul, which explores moving beyond the measuring self to embrace true presence.
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment** by Eckhart Tolle, focusing on present-moment awareness and transcending the ego.
- **The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself** by Michael A. Singer, a work that closely examines the nature of self and awareness.

**Question for Contemplation:** How can one cultivate a level of awareness that transcends the need for self-assessment in spiritual practice, allowing for a deeper recognition of one's true nature?
