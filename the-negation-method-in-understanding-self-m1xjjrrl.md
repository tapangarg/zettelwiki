**Note 3: The 'Neti-Neti' Approach to Self-Discovery**  
**Title:** The Negation Method in Understanding Self  
**Quote:** "Whatever is clearly not me, we are keeping aside... I cannot be this."  
**Translation into Modern English:** We systematically discard anything that is clearly not part of our true self, affirming that these changing aspects of the world cannot define us.  
**Explanation:** The 'Neti-Neti' technique serves as an important tool for self-discovery in the quest for understanding one’s true nature. By using negation—recognizing and dismissing aspects of experience and identity that are clearly impermanent or external—individuals can hone in on the unchanging essence of the self. In affirming "Not that," practitioners create space away from the distractions of the sensory and conceptual world, leading to clarity about what constitutes their true identity. This methodical process is significant in helping practitioners disentangle themselves from societal roles and transient experiences, facilitating a more profound realization of their spiritual nature.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Concept of ‘Maya’:** In Hindu philosophy, this relates to the illusion of the material world, reinforcing the importance of discerning reality from illusion.  
- **Existential Inquiry:** Philosophical explorations of existence can mirror the negation method by seeking to identify what remains when all external identities are stripped away.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** The essence of mindfulness—observing thoughts without attachment—parallels the practice of 'Neti-Neti'.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali:** Often emphasizes discernment between the real and the unreal, which resonates with the negation technique.  
- **The Clear Light of Bliss:** By Chögyam Trungpa, which touches on the nature of perception and reality in self-discovery.  
- **The Tao of Pooh:** By Benjamin Hoff, which explains Eastern philosophy’s approach to understanding the self through simplicity and negation.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does the practice of negating aspects of your identity help you to connect with a deeper sense of self? What remains after you have let go of societal labels?
