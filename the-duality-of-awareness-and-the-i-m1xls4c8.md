**Note 1: The Nature of Awareness**  
**Title:** The Duality of Awareness and the 'I'  
**Quote:** "What is at the root of this? I am aware. What is this Awareness?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** What lies at the core of our existence? I notice that I am conscious. What does it mean to be conscious?  
**Explanation:** The text explores the profound question of what Awareness truly is. It emphasizes the significance of turning our attentive focus away from our myriad of distractions imposed by emotions, thoughts, and sensory experiences to deeper introspection. In doing so, we encounter the enigmatic quality of 'I' – the subject experiencing Awareness. This inquiry into Awareness and the accompanying identity – the 'I' – leads us toward a fundamental exploration of self. The essence of this question lies in understanding whether this 'I' is distinct or intertwined with the Awareness itself, thereby highlighting a critical quest for deeper self-knowledge and spiritual inquiry. Recognizing the nature of our Awareness can facilitate profound personal growth by aligning our understanding of self with broader existential principles.  
**Connections:**  
- **Advaita Vedanta Philosophy:** This tradition posits that the individual self (Atman) is ultimately non-different from the absolute reality (Brahman), which relates closely to the exploration of the relationship between the 'I' and Awareness.  
- **Mindfulness and Meditation Practices:** Such practices encourage focusing on Awareness, making the subject/object distinction clearer and facilitating experiences of non-duality.  
- **Existential Philosophy:** Thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre ponder the nature of consciousness and self-identity, posing similar inquiries into the nature of 'I'.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That:** A collection of talks by Nisargadatta Maharaj that delve into the nature of existence and non-duality.  
- **The Book of Not Knowing:** By Peter Ralston, which investigates the concepts of consciousness and self-awareness.  
- **Be As You Are: The Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi:** A detailed exploration of self-inquiry and the quest to understand Awareness and the 'I'.  
**Question for Contemplation:** To what extent does the understanding of my Awareness inform my identity, and how might this awareness shape my interactions and experiences in the world?
