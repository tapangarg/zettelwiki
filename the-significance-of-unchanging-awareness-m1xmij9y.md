**Note 3: The Essence of Stillness**  
**Title:** The Significance of Unchanging Awareness  
**Quote:** “If we just see that if we are able to put our attention into that which is unchanging, unmoving..., which is right here actually.”  
**Translation into Modern English:** Recognizing and placing our attention on the unchanging essence of our being can lead to a deeper sense of awareness and connection to existence itself.  
**Explanation:** This exploration of stillness emphasizes the importance of redirecting attention from fleeting thoughts and beliefs to the underlying essence that remains constant throughout our lives. The idea of an unchanging core is associated with profound peace and transformative understanding, creating opportunities for deeper self-awareness and personal growth. By merging our attention with this stillness, we cultivate a state of being that transcends the chaos and turmoil of surface-level experiences, leading to a more integrated sense of self and deepening our connection with the world around us.  
**Connections:**
