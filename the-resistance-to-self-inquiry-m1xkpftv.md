**Note 2: The Nature of Resistance**  
**Title:** The Resistance to Self-Inquiry  
**Quote:** "If we had no investment in the person idea... then this will not cause so much resistance."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When we are not emotionally attached to the notion of being a fixed ‘person,’ we can engage in self-inquiry with ease, without much inner conflict.  
**Explanation:** The text reflects on how our attachment to our idea of self creates resistance in the process of self-examination. When we cling to the identity of being a ‘person,’ it leads to defensiveness and a fear of losing what we think we are. However, during self-inquiry, if we approach our investigation without attachment, we can freely explore the depths of our existence without the weight of expectation or judgment. This state of openness allows for a more genuine understanding of our being, ultimately paving the way for liberation from the constraints of ego.  
**Connections:**

- **Surrender in Spiritual Practice:** Many spiritual teachings emphasize yielding to the present moment to dissolve inner conflicts regarding identity.

- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which emphasizes living in the present moment as a way to release the burdens of identity.

**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing and releasing our investments in identities impact our emotional well-being and relationships with others?
