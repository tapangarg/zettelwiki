**Note 1: The Essence of Love and Divine Connection**  
**Title:** Love as Service to the Divine  
**Quote:** "The true purpose of love, peace and joy... will start to reveal itself... they are just here and there is no concern about them being here or not."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The genuine purpose of love, peace, and joy unfolds as we understand that these energies exist to serve the Divine. They are ever-present around us, and we don't have to fret about their absence; they naturally gravitate towards the Divine.  
**Explanation:** This idea centers around viewing love, peace, and joy not as transient emotions that we possess or strive for, but as essential aspects of our higher selves that align with the Divine. When we drop our identification with our personal self, and embrace our connection to this greater Being, these vibrant energies manifest effortlessly. They no longer become something we must chase after; rather, they naturally occupy our space and consciousness, rooted in the presence of the Divine within ourselves and around us. The realization that these states are inherent to our being can help alleviate stress related to their absence and transform how we approach love and joy in our lives.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality:** The concept that the self is not separate from the Divine being and emphasizes the unity of existence.  
- **Zen Practice of Presence:** The practice of being fully present teaches that joy and peace are accessed in the moment, similar to the recognition of inherent divine energies.  
- **The Law of Attraction:** Understanding that focusing on positive energies invites more of them into our lives resonates with the idea that love and joy are inherently present when we connect with the Divine.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment** by Eckhart Tolle, which discusses the importance of presence in accessing deeper states of being and awareness.  
- **The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself** by Michael A. Singer, explores the relationship between personal identity and the experience of love and joy.  
- **Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life** by Marshall Rosenberg, which emphasizes understanding and expressing our needs for love and connection.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does perceiving love, peace, and joy as inherently linked to the Divine change your approach to experiencing these emotions in daily life?
