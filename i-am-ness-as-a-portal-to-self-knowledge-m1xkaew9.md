**Note 1: The Dual Nature of 'I Am-ness'**  
**Title:** 'I Am-ness' as a Portal to Self-Knowledge  
**Quote:** "This is what I mean by ‘I Am-ness’ being a portal which can go both ways."  
**Translation into Modern English:** 'I Am-ness' serves as a gateway that enables exploration of both the illusion of ego and the deeper truth of existence.  
**Explanation:** The concept of 'I Am-ness' is a profound inquiry into the nature of self-awareness. It acknowledges that while 'I Am' can be used superficially to construct a sense of identity or ego, it simultaneously opens up a deeper recognition of pure existence or consciousness. This duality is critical for understanding the layers of self-perception – recognizing the self as both the individual ego with attributes and as the pure awareness that transcends these attributes. This awareness goes beyond the merely definable self, indicating that there is a fundamental aspect of existence that is beyond characterization, leading us toward deeper self-realization and spiritual growth.   
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Dual Awareness:** The understanding that what we perceive as separate (the individual ego) is, at a deeper level, united with the universal consciousness.  
- **Ego vs. True Self:** A contrast often explored in spiritual teachings, highlighting the differences between superficial identity and the authentic essence of self.  
- **Ramana Maharshi's Teachings:** The significance of self-inquiry and understanding the nature of 'I' as articulated by this esteemed teacher.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"Who Am I?" by Ramana Maharshi:** A classic text on self-inquiry and understanding the true self.  
- **"The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle:** This book explores presence, self-awareness, and the pains of ego identification.  
- **"I Am That" by Nisargadatta Maharaj:** Dialogues on non-duality and the essence of consciousness beyond identity.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can recognizing the duality of 'I Am-ness' deepen our understanding of personal identity and facilitate a journey toward recognizing our true essence?
