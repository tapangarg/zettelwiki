**Note 1: The Essence of Pure Beingness**  
**Title:** The Distinction Between Being and Thought  
**Quote:** "It is not the thought 'I am'. Many of us mistake the sense ‘I Am’ to be the thought 'I am'. This Being is prior to thought."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The experience of simply 'Being' should not be confused with the cognitive acknowledgment of 'I am'. In fact, this sense of existence transcends thought itself.  
**Explanation:** The text emphasizes a fundamental philosophical distinction between the experience of 'Being' and the mental framework that expresses it through thought. This distinction is crucial as many believe that the essence of existence can be encapsulated in the thought process. However, true Being exists independently of any thoughts or narratives we construct around it. Reaching an awareness of this pure Beingness allows for profound self-inquiry and understanding of existence itself, as it underscores a state of awareness that persists regardless of mental activity. This awareness precedes thoughts and is central to various contemplative practices aimed at deeper self-reflection and understanding.  
**Connections:**  
- **Advaita Vedanta:** A Hindu philosophy that teaches the non-duality of the self and pure consciousness as its essence.  
- **Existential Phenomenology:** Examines the nature of existence and the objects of human experience, which emphasize Being beyond thought.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques focused on cultivating awareness, encouraging individuals to experience existence without the filter of thought.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That:** By Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj; a classic text on the inquiry into the nature of Being and consciousness.  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle; discusses presence and being as a path to spiritual enlightenment.  
- **Being and Time:** By Martin Heidegger; an exploration of the nature of being that lays the groundwork for existential philosophy.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What practices can lead us to a clearer understanding of our own Being beyond the constructs of thought?
