**Note 2: The Nature of Attributes in Identity Formation**

**Title:** The Burden of Self-Attributed Labels

**Quote:** “We keep attaching many, many attributes to this ‘Am-ness’. But what are we looking for? We are looking for the ‘I’ which is prior to this.”

**Translation into Modern English:** We tend to add countless labels and definitions to our sense of 'I Am', but our true quest is to discover the essence of 'I' that exists beyond all these tags.

**Explanation:** Human identity is often constructed through various attributes and self-identifications. We define ourselves through our actions, beliefs, and roles, creating a complex persona. However, this fascination with self-definition distracts us from the essence of our being. The essence of 'I', which exists prior to these attributes, is often obscured by the weight of these self-imposed labels. Recognizing this quest for the pure 'I' is pivotal for personal development, as it encourages a shift from a fragmented self to a unified existence. Understanding this layer of identity allows for a profound realization that we are not our thoughts, roles, or experiences but the silent observer behind them.

**Connections:**
- **Existentialism:** Examining the quest for authenticity and the essence of being beyond societal labels.
- **Zen Buddhism:** The practice of mindfulness helps to diminish attachment to identity and encourages direct experience of present reality.
- **Spiritual Surrender:** The concept of surrendering personal identity in favor of experiencing the divine essence within.
