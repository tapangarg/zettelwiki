**Note 1: Demonic Influence in Spiritual Journeys**

**Title:** The Role of Demonic Resistance in Spiritual Growth  

**Quote:** "The sickness which overtook me certainly came from the demon; infuriated by your entrance into Carmel, he wanted to take revenge on me for the wrong our family was to do him in the future."  

**Translation into Modern English:** The illness that affected me was surely caused by the demon; he was enraged by your joining Carmel and sought to take revenge on me for the future harm our family was meant to bring to him.   

**Explanation:** St. Thérèse of Lisieux describes her illness as inflicted by demonic forces, responding to spiritual advancements or significant life choices that threaten these negative forces. Such interpretations highlight a common belief in spiritual warfare, where individuals perceive physical or emotional suffering as an external manifestation of spiritual conflict.
