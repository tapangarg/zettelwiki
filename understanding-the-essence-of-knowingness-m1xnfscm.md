**Note 1: The Nature of Knowingness**  
**Title:** Understanding the Essence of Knowingness  
**Quote:** "This Knowingness is not perceived. It is just Knowing by Itself."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Knowingness exists inherently and is not something we perceive like the physical world; it just is.  
**Explanation:** The text emphasizes the distinction between awareness and phenomena. Unlike physical objects or sensations that our minds can categorize and validate, "Knowingness" transcends the limitations of perception and is an intrinsic quality of consciousness. This understanding invites a deeper exploration of our relationship with our own awareness and challenges us to go beyond empirical, sensory-based methods of discovery. We are often trained to seek validation through the tangible, which can lead to a misidentification of our true essence. Recognizing that "Knowingness" is simpler and more primal than our usual experiences is key to a more profound understanding of consciousness itself.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Dual Awareness:** The concept of awareness that exists beyond the subject-object dichotomy, fundamental in Eastern philosophies like Advaita Vedanta.  
- **Phenomenology:** A philosophical approach that studies structures of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view, highlighting the disconnect between our experiences and the essence of awareness.  
- **Mystical Experiences:** Many spiritual traditions discuss direct experiences of awareness that align with this concept, pointing to the ineffable nature of true understanding.  
**Further Reading:**

- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment by Eckhart Tolle** - Discusses the importance of presence and transcending the ego.  
- **Being and Time by Martin Heidegger** - An exploration of being that touches on the difference between phenomena and underlying existence.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can we shift our focus from seeking external validation of our awareness to an intrinsic understanding of our Knowingness?
