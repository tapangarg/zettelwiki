**Note 1: The Illusion of Self in Daily Life**  
**Title:** Questioning the Presence of Self in Everyday Actions  
**Quote:** “You have to run your life. You have to make breakfast. You have to pay bills’..., the question is ‘Who?’ I don’t find anybody here.”  
**Translation into Modern English:** You are responsible for handling your daily life, managing tasks like making breakfast and paying bills; however, when questioned about who is actually doing these tasks, I cannot identify a true self or entity present.  
**Explanation:** This statement provokes deep introspection regarding the nature of the self. The routine actions required in daily life imply the presence of an individual responsible for these tasks. Yet, upon closer examination, one may question the existence of a concrete "I" that directs these activities. This realization can lead to an understanding that the idea of a singular self might be a construct or an illusion. Recognizing this can liberate individuals from the rigidity of their identity and encourage a more fluid interaction with life and its responsibilities. It invites contemplation on the nature of agency and existence, recognizing that life unfolds in a series of responses rather than through a centralized will.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality:** The idea aligns with non-dual philosophies which reject the notion of a separate, fixed self and instead emphasize unity with all existence.  
- **Zen Buddhism:** The concept of 'no-self' (anatta) in Zen teaches that attachment to the self is a source of suffering.  
- **Existential Philosophies:** The contemplation of existence and the essence of being can also be enriched through the lens of existential thinkers like Sartre or Heidegger.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Siddhartha:** By Hermann Hesse, which explores self-discovery and the questioning of identity in the journey of life.  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which delves into the nature of self and the importance of being present rather than identified with thoughts and ego.  
- **I Am That:** By Nisargadatta Maharaj, a collection of teachings focused on the nature of self and the pursuit of spiritual realization.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What does the realization that there may be 'no one here' mean for our understanding of personal responsibility and agency in the world?
