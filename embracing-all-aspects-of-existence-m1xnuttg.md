**Note 1: The Essence of Unity and Allowance**  
**Title:** Embracing All Aspects of Existence  
**Quote:** "Once you see that You Are Everything then there is also an allowing of everything, because you are no longer pushing an aspect of yourself away..."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When you realize that your true nature encompasses all existence, you naturally allow everything to be part of your experience because you no longer reject any part of yourself.  
**Explanation:** This passage emphasizes the profound realization of unity with all existence, suggesting that when one recognizes their intrinsic connection to everything, the tendencies of desire and aversion dissipate. Instead of identifying as a separate entity making choices based on self-interest, one begins to see the interconnectedness of life. This shift towards allowance implies a deep acceptance of all experiences, leading to a more peaceful existence devoid of conflict arising from rejection or craving. The significance of this idea lies in its potential to foster deeper compassion and understanding, as the perception of division between self and others dissolves.
