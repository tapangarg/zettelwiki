**Note 3: The Illusion of Separation**

**Title:** Maya: The Illusion of the Separate Self  
**Quote:** "Maya: The illusion that the world (both inner and outer) is real and is made of separate and independent parts."  
**Explanation:** Maya refers to the misleading perception that we and our experiences exist as separate entities, creating a dualistic worldview where division and conflict can thrive. In contrast, understanding Maya illuminates the fundamental interconnectedness of all existence, helping seekers break free from the illusions caused by the mind. By recognizing that what we perceive as separation is merely a layer of illusion, we can begin to engage with reality from a place of unity and compassion, fostering personal growth and broader understanding of our shared existence.
