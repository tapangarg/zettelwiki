**Note 1: The Nature of Timeless Awareness**  
**Title:** Understanding the ‘I’ and the Timeless Awareness  
**Quote:** “at this ‘I’ is the Timeless Awareness, within which (what he used to call) the sense ‘I-I’ (which we call the sense I Am) is born, and it dissolves back into.”  
**Translation into Modern English:** The ‘I’ refers to a state of Timeless Awareness, from which our sense of self—what is often referred to as ‘I Am’—emerges, only to return to this awareness again.  
**Explanation:** The passage introduces the profound concept of Timeless Awareness, emphasizing its significance in understanding the self. This 'I' represents the essence of existence, free from qualities or attributes that our minds often attach. Recognizing this core aspect of self-awareness leads to the realization that our true nature is one with the universal essence, the Absolute. In this framework, we are encouraged to see ourselves as a part of a greater whole, transcending the divisions fostered by our individual thoughts and identities. Such awareness fosters growth and understanding, allowing individuals to connect with a state of being that is both profound and liberating.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality:** The teachings of non-duality, particularly in Advaita Vedanta, emphasize the oneness of self and the universe, underpinning the idea that our separateness is an illusion.  
- **Mindfulness:** Practices centered around mindfulness and awareness connect deeply with this concept, as they focus on becoming aware of one's own consciousness.  
- **Spiritual Awakening:** The idea that many seekers struggle with the recognition of true awareness due to expectations of dramatic experiences, as seen in countless spiritual traditions.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That:** By Nisargadatta Maharaj, a collection of teachings exploring the concept of non-duality and the essence of the 'I.'  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which delves into present moment awareness and its connection to consciousness.  
- **The Book of Secrets:** By Osho, discussing various aspects of awareness and consciousness, including practical insights for seekers.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing your essence as Timeless Awareness change your perception of personal identity and existence in the world?
