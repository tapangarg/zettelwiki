**Note 1: The Challenge of Loving the Difficult**

**Title:** Embracing Imperfections in Relationships

**Quote:** "What made Thérèse a saint was that she chose to love the people whom God placed upon her path, those whom she was attracted to and those who repelled her."

**Translation into Modern English:** Thérèse became a saint by consciously deciding to love everyone around her, including those she found challenging or unappealing.

**Explanation:** This insight from St. Thérèse highlights a fundamental aspect of human relationships: the challenge of interacting with imperfect individuals. Love, particularly for those difficult to connect with, is portrayed as a conscious choice rather than a spontaneous feeling. St. Thérèse's example offers a profound understanding of virtue and holiness, framing love as an action to be cultivated, even towards those who challenge us.
