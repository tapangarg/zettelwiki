**Note 1: The Nature of Awareness**  
**Title:** Exploring the Essence of Awareness  
**Quote:** "Do you have a weight? Do you have a size? Do you have any attributes? Do you have a shape? Do you have a color? Do you have a past? Will you have a future?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** What characteristics define your awareness? Does it possess measurable dimensions or qualities? Does it have a history or a trajectory?  
**Explanation:** The text delves into the investigation of awareness, challenging our preconceived notions about the 'I' or the self. It poses questions that highlight the absence of physical attributes or historical context within pure awareness. Instead, it urges us to look beyond memory and concepts to understand the nature of our awareness as a non-objective, timeless presence. Recognizing that awareness does not conform to physical or conceptual limitations can lead to deeper self-understanding and spiritual growth, fostering a sense of connectedness beyond personal identity.  
**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness and Present Moment Awareness:** The practice of being fully present and aware cultivates a connection to the essence of awareness without the filters of past experiences or future concerns.  
- **Non-duality:** A core concept in Eastern philosophies referring to the interconnectedness of all things, removing the separation between the observer ('I') and the observed (awareness).  
- **Contemplative Practices:** Various spiritual traditions emphasize self-inquiry and observation as tools for accessing deeper truths about self and awareness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which emphasizes living in present awareness and the importance of distinguishing between self and awareness.  
- **I Am That:** By Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, exploring non-dual awareness and the nature of self in relation to the Absolute.  
- **Being Nobody, Going Nowhere:** By Ajahn Chah, which discusses the essence of awareness through simple meditation practices.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does stripping away our attributes redefine our understanding of self and influence our spiritual journey?
