**Note 3: The Fear of Returning to Seeking**  
**Title:** The Cost of Pretend Enlightenment  
**Quote:** "we would rather be a pretend-enlightened being, enlightened ‘person’ than go back to the pretend-seeking..."  
**Translation into Modern English:** We may choose to maintain a facade of enlightenment rather than risk returning to the uncomfortable state of being a seeker, which often entails grappling with unanswered questions and deeper layers of suffering.  

**Explanation:** This quote speaks to a prevalent phenomenon in spiritual practice: the temptation to adopt a false sense of enlightenment to avoid the discomfort of deeper searching. The fear of losing the self-identified status of an 'enlightened being' often overshadows the truth of one’s ongoing journey and the work that still lies ahead. It emphasizes that true enlightenment is not a fixed state, but rather a continuous process of self-discovery and overcoming the illusions of identity.

Acknowledging this phenomenon bears great significance, as it encourages practitioners to confront the reality of their ongoing journey rather than resting on comfortable illusions. Recognizing this tendency can liberate individuals from stagnation and foster genuine spiritual maturity.
