**Note 1: Understanding the Nature of Knowing**  
**Title:** The Duality of Mental Knowing  
**Quote:** "It is still knowing; which fluctuates between having a concept of something or not having a concept of something; or not having a clear concept of something."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Even when we claim to 'know' something, our understanding can vary widely; we may have a clear concept at one moment and experience confusion the next. This state of fluctuating awareness is part of the nature of knowing itself.  
**Explanation:** The discussion here highlights that the nature of knowing is not static; it can oscillate between clarity and confusion. The term 'knowing' often evokes images of having a certain grasp of a concept or a visual representation in our minds. However, the speaker invites a deeper reflection on this notion by indicating that there are moments when we can acknowledge our lack of clarity, stating 'I don't know.' This admission does not negate our capacity for knowing, but showcases its fluidity. Understanding that knowing is not just about having a definitive answer, but also embracing the moments of uncertainty and blankness, can profoundly affect how we engage with knowledge and understanding. This perspective encourages growth, as accepting ambiguity often leads to deeper inquiry and learning.

- **Mindfulness and Presence:** The practice of being present can enhance our capacity to understand and approach our experiences without the burden of conceptualization.  
- **Critical Thinking and Uncertainty:** How embracing uncertainty can lead to more thorough critical thinking and prevents the rigidity of fixed beliefs.

- **Being and Time by Martin Heidegger:** A philosophical investigation into existence and understanding, shedding light on the complexities of being and knowing.  
- **The Tao of Pooh by Benjamin Hoff:** A light-hearted approach to Taoist principles that emphasize simplicity and knowing, contrasting with complex thinking.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can acknowledging our moments of 'not knowing' lead to greater clarity and wisdom in our pursuit of understanding?
