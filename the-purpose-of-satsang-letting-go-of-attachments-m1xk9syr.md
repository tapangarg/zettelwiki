**Note 3: The Role of Satsang in Self-Discovery**

**Title:** The Purpose of Satsang: Letting Go of Attachments

**Quote:** “The entire point of satsang is to drop these ideas which we have been attaching to ourselves.”

**Translation into Modern English:** The main purpose of gathering in a spiritual community (satsang) is to release the beliefs and ideas that we have accepted as part of our identities.

**Explanation:** Satsang, which is often seen as a gathering for truth-seeking and spiritual discourse, plays a crucial role in helping individuals recognize and shed the attachments they have developed over time. In the context of spiritual growth, participants explore concepts of identity and the self, aiding one another in the journey of letting go of these false attributions to reveal a more authentic self. This process of dropping attachments is essential because it allows us to experience our intrinsic nature without the distortions of identity shaped by societal influences or personal experiences. Overall, satsang is beneficial as it cultivates a space where individuals can collectively support each other towards the realization of a deeper truth that exists beyond personal identifiers.
