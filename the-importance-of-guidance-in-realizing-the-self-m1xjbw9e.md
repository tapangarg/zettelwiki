**Note 3: The Role of Teachers in Spiritual Awakening**  
**Title:** The Importance of Guidance in Realizing the Self  
**Quote:** "Ananta shares Satsang with the blessings of his Guru, Shri Mooji."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Ananta conducts Satsang under the auspices and support of his teacher, Mooji, reflecting the importance of having a spiritual guide.  

**Explanation:** The teacher-student relationship is pivotal in many spiritual traditions, serving as a vessel for knowledge, experience, and awakening. Ananta’s connection to Mooji signifies a lineage that provides both authority and wisdom to his teachings. The idea is that a teacher, having traversed the path toward realization, can illuminate the way for students who are striving towards the same goal. Through their blessings and guidance, seekers are often inspired to delve deeper into their inquiry, encouraging a more profound understanding of Self. This dynamic not only enriches the seeker’s journey but also reinforces the collective aspect of spiritual growth as knowledge is transmitted and shared.
