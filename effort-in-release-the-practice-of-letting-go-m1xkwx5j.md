**Note 2: The Effort of Non-Attachment**  
**Title:** Effort in Release: The Practice of Letting Go  
**Quote:** "It seems like there is effort in not to pick it up."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Initially, it may feel challenging to refrain from engaging with intrusive thoughts, but this effort is a crucial part of the process.  
**Explanation:** The paradoxical assertion that "not picking it up" involves effort speaks to a fundamental aspect of personal transformation: the journey towards conscious awareness often requires deliberate actions. The author implies that it is habitual for individuals to engage with negative thoughts, and breaking this pattern can feel strenuous at first. However, the suggestion is to lean into this effort, affirming it as a necessary step towards achieving a mental state of non-attachment. This process underlines the significance of recognizing our conditioning and choosing to respond differently, ultimately leading to liberation from harmful thought patterns. As such, acknowledging the initial difficulty of non-attachment is an essential part of integrating this understanding into our daily lives, which fosters greater well-being.
