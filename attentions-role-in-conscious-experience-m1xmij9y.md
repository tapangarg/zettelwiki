**Note 2: The Power of Attention**  
**Title:** Attention's Role in Conscious Experience  
**Quote:** “So we see that this attention has presumably been operating...only because it has been accompanied by this thought pattern saying ‘What’s in it for me?’”  
**Translation into Modern English:** Our attention often operates under a mental narrative that seeks personal gain or benefit, rather than being directed towards a deeper understanding or stillness.  
**Explanation:** This concept uncovers how our attention is frequently influenced by self-centered motivations. This inclination towards personal gain shapes our experiences and interactions, leading us to constantly seek fulfillment through external means. Acknowledging the inherent tendency to focus on the self opens the door to recognizing the potential for redirecting attention towards more profound aspects of existence. By consciously choosing where to place our focus, we can cultivate a state of stillness and presence that transcends the noise of daily distractions, allowing for more meaningful engagement with our inner selves.
