**Note 1: The Nature of Awareness**  
**Title:** Understanding Our Own Awareness  
**Quote:** "I kind of forgot. I don’t remember now what I was thinking. [...] I don’t know if I am aware of the awareness."  
**Translation into Modern English:** I lost track of my thoughts and cannot recall exactly what was on my mind. However, I am contemplating whether I am conscious of my own consciousness.   
**Explanation:** This exchange highlights a profound inquiry into one's awareness and existence. The individual expresses a confusion that many face—the struggle to recognize whether we are fully aware of our own state of awareness. This self-reflective questioning is crucial as it forces us to confront the nature of our own consciousness, which can lead to a deeper understanding of self and existence. The significance lies in the awareness that is separate from thought; recognizing this distinction can foster a more profound state of presence and connection with our true selves. Understanding our awareness assists us in letting go of external identifications and discomforts, promoting inner peace.  
**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness Meditation:** The practice emphasizes present moment awareness and can help cultivate a deeper recognition of one's thoughts and feelings without attachment.  
- **Philosophical Inquiry into Consciousness:** Many philosophical traditions explore the nature of consciousness and the self, addressing the question of how we know that we are aware.  
- **Non-Duality:** This perspective emphasizes the unity of awareness and being, suggesting that separating the 'aware' from the 'awareness' leads to suffering.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now** by Eckhart Tolle, which discusses presence and awareness in everyday life.  
- **I Am That** by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, which offers insights into self-realization and non-duality.  
- **Being Aware of Being Aware** by Adyashanti, which explores the depth of awareness and its implications for personal growth.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing the awareness behind your thoughts change your perception of yourself and the world around you?
