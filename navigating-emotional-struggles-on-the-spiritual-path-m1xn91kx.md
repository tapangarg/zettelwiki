**Note 3: The Impact of Emotional Struggles on Spirituality**  
**Title:** Navigating Emotional Struggles on the Spiritual Path  
**Quote:** "There are so many in the Sangha can keep beating themselves up. ‘If I’m free, then why do I still feel desire or lust?’ It’s okay. You see?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Many individuals in the spiritual community often struggle with negative self-talk regarding their desires and emotions, questioning their freedom due to persistent feelings of desire or lust. It's important to remember that these feelings are acceptable and part of the human experience.  
**Explanation:** This excerpt sheds light on a common issue faced by individuals on their spiritual journeys—self-doubt prompted by feelings that seem contrary to the ideals of freedom and enlightenment. The struggle between the ideals of spiritual ascension and the reality of human emotions can lead to guilt and frustration. Recognizing that it is "okay" to experience desire, even as one seeks higher states of consciousness, allows for a healthier, more compassionate approach to spiritual practice. It emphasizes self-acceptance and an understanding that emotional experiences do not negate spiritual progress.
