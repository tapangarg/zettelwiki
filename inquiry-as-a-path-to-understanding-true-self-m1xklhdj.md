**Note 3: The Role of Inquiry in Spiritual Growth**  
**Title:** Inquiry as a Path to Understanding True Self  
**Quote:** "Because he said that either we inquire..."  
**Translation into Modern English:** As Ramana Maharshi suggested, we can either engage in inquiry into the nature of our existence or remain caught in concepts that perpetuate separation.  
**Explanation:** Inquiry serves as a pivotal tool for spiritual growth and understanding of the self. The text references Ramana Maharshi, who advocated for deep self-inquiry as a means to penetrate beyond the layers of ego and conceptualization. This process of questioning leads to profound insights about the nature of self and reality. Unlike passive beliefs or conceptual understandings, inquiry encourages engagement and active exploration of truths. It challenges practitioners to dig deeper, seeking clarity about their own existence and the narratives they hold. The significance of inquiry lies in its ability to dismantle pre-existing notions, allowing a more fluid and direct experience of reality to emerge. This technique can reveal tremendous insights about the self and how it relates to the greater whole.
