**Note 3: Deep Sleep and Consciousness**  
**Title:** Consciousness and the Absence of Belief in Deep Sleep  
**Quote:** "In deep sleep state there is no question of belief, isn't it? There is no Consciousness there, so no question of belief."  
**Translation into Modern English:** During deep sleep, there is a complete absence of belief because Consciousness is not present.  
**Explanation:** This observation about deep sleep reflects the idea that belief—requiring Consciousness—is suspended in this state. It serves to illustrate that without Consciousness, thoughts and beliefs become irrelevant. This distinction highlights the deep connection between Consciousness and the formation of beliefs, suggesting that our awareness is the engine behind belief formation and our subjective experiences. Recognizing this can encourage a reevaluation of how we engage with our waking thoughts and cultivate an understanding that deeper states of rest or presence might be more aligned with pure existence rather than identification with fleeting beliefs.
