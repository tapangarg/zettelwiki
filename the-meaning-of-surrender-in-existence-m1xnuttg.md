**Note 2: Surrendering to Existence**  
**Title:** The Meaning of Surrender in Existence  
**Quote:** "Only when I consider myself to be an object in the appearance can I say that I want another object. Once I see that I Am This in which everything is coming and going; I Am that which gives existence to existence..."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When I view myself merely as a separate object, I create desires for other things outside of myself. But once I realize that I am the essence from which all things arise and fall, my desires shift.  
**Explanation:** This passage suggests that the act of surrender to existence is fundamental to true understanding and fulfillment. When one views themselves as a separate object, desires spring from a lack or a craving for completion. However, recognizing oneself as the source of all existence transforms that perspective. Rather than longing for the external fulfillment, there is a realization that all of existence is part of a greater whole, of which you are an integral aspect. This understanding can liberate individuals from the mundane cycle of seeking gratification and instead promote living in alignment with the larger flow of life.  
**Connections:**

- **Existential Philosophy:** The exploration of existence, essence, and the inherent meaning (or lack thereof) in life.  
- **Spiritual Surrender:** The practice of letting go of control and trusting in the flow of existence.

- **The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself** by Michael A. Singer - discusses finding inner peace through surrendering to life.  
- **The Book of Not Knowing** by Peter Ralston - offers insights on the nature of consciousness and existence.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can surrendering to the flow of existence enrich your understanding of fulfillment and joy in life?
