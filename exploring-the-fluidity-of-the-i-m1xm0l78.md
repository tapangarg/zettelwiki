**Note 1: The Nature of the Self**  
**Title:** Exploring the Fluidity of the 'I'  
**Quote:** "Which is the ‘I’ which is coming and going? Is it the ‘I’ which is just an idea where we started; thought coming and going, emotions coming and going, body changing, coming and going, outside appearances coming and going?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** What is this 'I' that seems to appear and disappear? Is it merely an idea, comprised of shifting thoughts, emotions, physical changes, and changing external appearances?  
**Explanation:** This excerpt delves into the intricate nature of our sense of self. The speaker questions the very essence of the 'I' that we identify with—suggesting that what we call 'I' may just be a collection of transient experiences rather than a stable, unchanging entity. This exploration prompts profound contemplation about how much of our identity is tethered to fluctuating thoughts and emotions and whether we can find a more enduring aspect of ourselves beneath this shifting surface. Understanding this can lead to greater self-awareness, ultimately allowing us to detach from the impermanence of our experiences and see the deeper essence of consciousness.  
**Connections:**  
- **Buddhist Concept of Anatta (Non-Self):** Buddhism teaches that our sense of self is an illusion and emphasizes the transient nature of personal identity.  
- **Eastern Philosophy of Impermanence:** Many Eastern philosophies discuss the idea that everything is in constant flux, urging us to recognize the impermanent nature of our thoughts and feelings.  
- **Western Existential Philosophy:** Thinkers like Sartre highlight the fluidity of identity in the context of human experience, emphasizing that we are continually becoming rather than simply being.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which discusses presence and the essence of self beyond thoughts and emotions.  
- **Being and Nothingness:** By Jean-Paul Sartre, which explores human existence and the nature of selfhood in existential philosophy.  
- **What the Buddha Taught:** By Walpola Rahula, which addresses key principles of Buddhism, including the concept of non-self.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does the understanding of 'I' as a transient concept influence our approach to identity, relationships, and personal growth?
