**Note 1: The Nature of True 'I'**

**Title:** Understanding the Non-Phenomenal 'I'

**Quote:** "This is what Bhagavan [Ramana Maharshi] was pointing to when he said ‘The ‘I’ removes the ‘I’ and yet remains the ‘I’. So the false ‘I’ is removed, but the true ‘I’ which is Awareness Itself remains."

**Translation into Modern English:** Ramana Maharshi highlighted that the 'I' can be viewed paradoxically. While the identification with the false self can be dissolved, what persists is the fundamental 'I' that embodies pure Awareness.

**Explanation:** The exploration of the true 'I' necessitates acknowledgment of the false 'I,' which is associated with our identification as a body-mind complex. This distinction is pivotal in understanding our own consciousness. Maharshi points out that by relinquishing the false sense of self—rooted in ego and objectivity—we can access the true 'I' that is just Awareness itself. This realization is deceptively simple, as our minds often overcomplicate it, seeking to grasp clarity in phenomena or concepts. Awareness transcends all objectification, which is why we might overlook it; it cannot be found in the tangible but exists as an essential aspect of our being. The significance of this understanding lies in the potential for profound personal transformation and liberation from the habitual constructs of self that bind us to suffering.

**Connections:**
- **Advaita Vedanta:** This non-dual philosophy echoes the same principles, suggesting that ultimate reality transcends individual identities.
- **Buddhism's Concept of Anatta (Non-Self):** Buddhism shares a parallel view, emphasizing the absence of a permanent self, which aligns the understanding of the true 'I' with Buddhist doctrine.
- **Psychological Insights on Identity:** Modern psychology which explores the self-concept and identity also relates; a misidentification can lead to a range of existential dilemmas.

**Further Reading:**
- **"I Am That" by Nisargadatta Maharaj:** A series of dialogues that dive deep into the understanding of the self and the non-dual.
- **"The Essence of Awareness" by David R. Hawkins:** This book provides insights into the nature of consciousness and awareness, appealing to both spiritual and psychological perspectives.
- **"Who Am I?" by Ramana Maharshi:** A foundational text on self-inquiry and the nature of selfhood directly from one of the key proponents of non-dualism.

**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can recognizing the distinction between the false 'I' and the true 'I' facilitate a shift in how you engage with your thoughts and emotions?
