**Note 2: Inquiry into the Self**  
**Title:** Investigating the Nature of ‘I’  
**Quote:** "Who is the ‘I’ that Sees this or knows this or is aware of it?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Who is the self that perceives or holds this awareness?  
**Explanation:** This inquiry points to the deeper exploration of self-identity and consciousness. By asking who or what "I" is, it shifts the focus from the content of thoughts and perceptions to the essence of being itself. This existential question is central to many spiritual traditions and philosophical inquiries, aiming to peel back the layers of constructed identity to reveal the fundamental nature of self. Understanding this can lead to a realization of the broader experience of consciousness that is unaffected by the transient nature of thoughts and experiences.  
**Connections:**  
- **Existentialism:** Philosophers like Soren Kierkegaard and Jean-Paul Sartre explore the nature of self and existence, questioning what it means to be.  
- **Advaita Vedanta:** A non-dual philosophical tradition that focuses on the identity of self and ultimate reality, indicating that the separation of 'I' and 'Awareness' is an illusion.  
- **The Nature of the Ego:** Discussions in psychology and spirituality about the ego often lead to insights into the false constructs of self that obscure true Awareness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself** by Michael A. Singer, which explores the nature of self and consciousness.  
- **The Book of Not Knowing** by Peter Ralston, which addresses the exploration of self-awareness and identity.  
- **Who Am I?** by Ramana Maharshi, a classical text on self-inquiry that guides the reader toward understanding true identity beyond the ego.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does exploring the nature of ‘I’ help us understand our relationship with consciousness and the experiential world?
