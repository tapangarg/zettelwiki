**Note 4: The Nature of Confirmation**  
**Title:** Self-Validation Through Awareness  
**Quote:** “Only That Which Always Is... can confirm the existence of That Which Always Is.”  
**Translation into Modern English:** Only an unchanging reality can substantiate or acknowledge the presence of another unchanging reality.  
**Explanation:** The statement touches upon the philosophical quandary of validation and existence. It asserts that genuine recognition and affirmation of existence must come from a source that embodies the same quality it affirms. This principle underlines crucial spiritual insights, advocating that for one to warrant their sense of being and Awareness, they must access a deeper, consistent essence of existence rather than relying on fluctuating perceptions. This understanding is pivotal for spiritual growth as it redirects attention from external validations and transient experiences to the unending nature of Awareness itself.  
**Connections:**  
- **Ego vs. Essence:** The need for deep self-reflection on the difference between seeking external validation versus finding internal worth.  
- **Plato’s Theory of Forms:** Suggests abstract Forms or Ideas are necessary to understand the existence of particular forms, mirroring the necessity of unchanging Awareness to justify existence.  
- **Mystical Traditions:** Many traditions articulate similar concepts where the Divine or Absolute reality validates all existence from a fundamental place of constancy.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Mind Illuminated:** A Complete Meditation Guide Integrating Buddhist Wisdom and Brain Science by Culadasa (John Yates), elucidates clarity in understanding Awareness through mindfulness and meditation.  
- **A Course in Miracles:** Offers insights into the nature of reality and perception, aiming at awakening to true Awareness.  
- **The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety** by Alan Watts, discussing the necessity of realizing the transient nature of existence and finding security in Awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways do we seek external validation, and how can redirecting our focus to the unchanging nature of Awareness liberate us from dependency on external affirmation?
