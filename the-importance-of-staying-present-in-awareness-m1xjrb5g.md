**Note 1: The Essence of Presence**  
**Title:** The Importance of Staying Present in Awareness  
**Quote:** "Stay with the sense that You are here."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Remain mindful of the fact that you exist in this very moment.  
**Explanation:** This idea emphasizes the significance of maintaining a conscious awareness of one's own existence and presence. It suggests that by focusing on the here and now, individuals can cultivate a deeper understanding of themselves. The concept of ‘I Am-ness’ points to the fundamental state of being that transcends thoughts or external distractions. It encourages self-awareness, inviting one to witness their existence without being ensnared by the fluctuations of mind or the chaos of the external world. Truly being present allows for a more profound connection with one’s inner self and an appreciation for life as it unfolds in real-time.
