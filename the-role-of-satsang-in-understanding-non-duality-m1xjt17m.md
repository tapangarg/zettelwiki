**Note 1: Satsang and the Dissolution of Personhood**  
**Title:** The Role of Satsang in Understanding Non-Duality  
**Quote:** "Therefore the purpose of satsang is to dissolve this concept of personhood."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Thus, the main goal of satsang is to dismantle the idea that we are separate entities with distinct personhood.  
**Explanation:** Satsang, a gathering for truth, is aimed at helping individuals recognize the illusion of personal identity. This process is essential for spiritual growth, as the feeling of being a separate ‘person’ often leads to suffering and misunderstanding of one’s true nature. The notion of personhood can be a significant obstacle on the spiritual path, as it creates a false sense of individuality, separateness, and ultimately suffering. By dissolving this construct, one can begin to experience a sense of unity and interconnectedness with all existence. This realization can lead to profound liberation and peace.
