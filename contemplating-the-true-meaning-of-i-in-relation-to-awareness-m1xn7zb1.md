**Note 1: The Nature of 'I' and Awareness**  
**Title:** Contemplating the True Meaning of 'I' in Relation to Awareness  
**Quote:** "To refer to ourself as anything other than ‘I’ is arrogance; that there was some individual here which had the power to separate, really separate itself."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Claiming any identity other than 'I' suggests that there exists a separate entity that has the ability to distinguish itself from Awareness, which is not the case.  
**Explanation:** The speaker reflects on the profound and often misunderstood relationship between the concept of 'I' and the essence of Awareness. When individuals instinctively grasp the term 'I', they often do so out of a misguided belief that it represents personal identity. However, this identity—a false construct—creates separation from the true nature of Awareness. This suggests that real humility lies in acknowledging one's existence as Awareness itself, devoid of attributes. It challenges the assumption that recognizing oneself as Awareness is a display of arrogance; instead, the speaker argues it is an understanding of the true nature of existence. It prompts individuals to investigate their relationship with their thoughts and notions of self, confirming that Awareness exists beyond conditioning and personal narrative.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-duality:** A philosophical basis where the distinction between self and other dissolves, akin to the essence of Awareness being one with everything rather than separate.  
- **Ego vs. True Self:** The discussion touches on ego-centered identity versus the realization of the true self as Awareness, emphasizing that the ego often misuses the term 'I' to assert individuality.  
- **Spiritual Liberation:** Recognizing oneself as Awareness facilitates a deeper understanding of freedom from conditioning, which is a common theme in various spiritual traditions.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which delves into the nature of presence and the illusion of the ego.  
- **I Am That:** By Nisargadatta Maharaj, exploring the essence of self and the nature of reality from a non-dual perspective.  
- **The Book of Not Knowing:** By Peter Ralston, which examines the limits of knowledge and the path to spiritual understanding through realization of self.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does embracing the identity of 'I' as Awareness alter the way we perceive our experiences and relationship with the world around us?
