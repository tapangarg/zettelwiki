**Note 1: The Nature of Awareness**  
**Title:** Awareness: The Effortless State of Being  
**Quote:** "Awareness just IS. I cannot turn it off, I cannot make it brighter. It just IS. It is not coming and going."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Awareness exists inherently; it cannot be controlled or altered in intensity, and it remains constant.  
**Explanation:** This insight underscores the fundamental nature of awareness as an intrinsic quality of existence. It suggests that awareness is omnipresent and unchanging, unlike the fluctuating emotions and identities we adopt as individuals. By understanding awareness as a constant entity, we begin to see the futility in the efforts we exert in our daily lives. The notion that awareness can be toggled on or off suggests a misunderstanding of its true essence. This leads to a vital realization that the feeling of exhaustion or effort associated with being a person stems not from awareness itself, but from the burdens we carry as we navigate our identities and societal roles. When we start to recognize this, we can progress towards a state of simplicity and effortlessness, where awareness shines in its inherent clarity.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Concept of Mindfulness:** The practice of mindfulness emphasizes being present and recognizing awareness without judgment, aligning closely with the understanding of awareness as an intrinsic state.  
- **Eastern Philosophies on Consciousness:** Many Eastern traditions, such as Buddhism, highlight the nature of mind and awareness emphasizing that one’s true self is beyond thoughts, emotions, and identities.  
- **The Illusion of Ego:** The constant effort in maintaining a personal identity can be linked to the philosophical discussions surrounding the ego and the misconception of self that often leads to suffering.  
**Further Reading:**

- **Radical Acceptance: Embracing Your Life With the Heart of a Buddha** by Tara Brach—Explores how acceptance of one's current state can lead to deeper awareness and relaxation of effort.  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj—An exploration of the nature of existence and consciousness, highlighting the concept of awareness as the ultimate reality.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can recognizing the effortless nature of awareness alter the way we approach our daily struggles and life choices?
