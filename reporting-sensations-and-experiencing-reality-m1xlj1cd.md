**Note 3: Sensation and the Nature of Awareness**  
**Title:** Reporting Sensations and Experiencing Reality  
**Quote:** "The reporting of all the sensations, the physical discomfort or what is happening..., not to the person next to me, but to somewhere here, somewhere here."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The acknowledgment of sensations and physical discomfort happens internally, to a part of myself rather than directed externally towards others.  
**Explanation:** This statement emphasizes how sensations and physical experiences are often perceived in an intimate, internal mannerâ€”not as reports for others but rather as signals for our own awareness. The act of recognizing pain or discomfort internally invites a deeper understanding of how we process experiences and interact with our environment. Distinguishing between external perceptions and internal sensations highlights the journey of self-discovery and consciousness, revealing the layers of understanding involved in emotional and physical experiences. This awareness ultimately allows us to explore our reactions and cultivate mindfulness, permitting a richer and more authentic engagement with life.
