**Note 1: Understanding 'I Am' Beyond Identification**

**Title:** The Misidentification of Existence and Bodily Sensations

**Quote:** "my misunderstanding I think is that I'm too much identified with the bodily sensations and I'm interpreting them as the sense of 'I exist'."

**Translation into Modern English:** I realize that my confusion stems from being overly identified with my physical sensations, leading me to wrongly associate them with my existence.

**Explanation:** The text explores the notion of identity and existence, particularly how individuals often conflate their self-perception with physical sensations. The phrase “I Am” is presented as a more profound existence that transcends personal identity. When one is too attached to bodily sensations, they risk misunderstanding the essence of their being. This highlights the distinction between the transient nature of physical experiences and the deeper, more abiding sense of awareness that doesn't depend on the body. Recognizing ‘I Am’ as non-personal invites a more expansive understanding of existence that is not bound to one's physical sensations but rooted in a state of consciousness.

**Connections:**
- **Non-Dual Awareness:** Many spiritual traditions emphasize a state of awareness that recognizes the unity of existence beyond personal identification.
- **Buddhism:** The concept of “Anatta” or ‘non-self’ challenges the attachments to bodily sensations and the ego, leading to a deeper awareness of true existence.
- **Existential Philosophy:** Philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre discuss existence preceding essence, echoing the idea that identity is shaped more by experience and awareness than by physical attributes. 

**Further Reading:**
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment** by Eckhart Tolle, which delves into the idea of presence beyond physical identity.
- **Being and Time** by Martin Heidegger, which addresses concepts of existence and the meaning of 'being'.
- **The Heart of the Buddha’s Teaching** by Thich Nhat Hanh, which offers insights into understanding the self and the nature of existence.

**Question for Contemplation:** How can separating the sense of 'I' from bodily sensations lead to a more profound realization of one's true nature and existence?
