**Note 3: Letting Fear Be**  
**Title:** The Practice of Sitting with Fear  
**Quote:** "If you can take the wobbliness for some time, if you can take the fear, let it..."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Allow yourself to experience the feelings of instability and fear without reacting to them.  
**Explanation:** This idea highlights the importance of not immediately fleeing from feelings of fear or discomfort that emerge when we step into the unknown aspects of our being. By allowing ourselves to 'sit with' these feelings rather than hiding behind concepts or distractions, we create space for personal growth and understanding. This practice can lead to greater emotional resilience and the ability to confront challenges with equanimity. Embracing discomfort can catalyze transformation, helping us navigate the complexities of human experience with grace and confidence.

- **Emotional Intelligence:** The capacity to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions and the emotions of others, highlighted by Daniel Goleman.  
- **Spiritual Bypass:** The tendency to use spiritual practices or beliefs to avoid confronting painful feelings and realities instead of addressing them.

- **Radical Acceptance:** By Tara Brach, which emphasizes the power of embracing life as it is with compassion and mindfulness.  
- **The Gifts of Imperfection:** By Brené Brown, which explores embracing vulnerability as a source of strength.  
- **Mind Over Mood:** By Dennis Greenberger and Christine A. Padesky, offering techniques for managing emotion without avoidance.
