**Note 1: The Inquiry of Self-Awareness**  
**Title:** The Nature of Self-Inquiry and Its Varying Reception  
**Quote:** "When we check for ourselves ‘Who is this that is aware even of being?’ So this is what Bhagavan is pointing to."  
**Translation into Modern English:** We need to ask ourselves, “Who is the one that is aware of my own existence?” This question is central to the teachings of Bhagavan, who directs us towards self-inquiry.  

**Explanation:** The practice of self-inquiry, particularly the question "Who am I?" is integral to understanding one’s own consciousness. This inquiry aims to lead individuals to deeper self-awareness and ultimately to the realization of one's true nature. However, the text acknowledges that not everyone feels inclined to engage with this inquiry. Some may feel uncomfortable and may instinctively withdraw from such probing questions. This reaction is entirely valid. Self-inquiry can be an intense and sometimes daunting process, requiring readiness and a willingness to explore one's inner landscape. The acknowledgment of personal choice in spiritual pursuits fosters a more compassionate practice of self-exploration, recognizing that each individual may tread their own unique path toward understanding.  

**Connections:**  
- **Bhagavad Gita:** The exploration of self and duty within the context of philosophy and spirituality, emphasizing self-realization.  
- **Non-Duality:** Many spiritual traditions discuss the non-separation between self and the universe, echoing similar themes of inquiry into one’s existence.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Such as meditation, which encourages present-moment awareness that can lead to a natural inquiry.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, a seminal work that delves deeply into the nature of self-inquiry and consciousness.  
- **The Power of Now** by Eckhart Tolle, focusing on awareness and presence as pathways to understanding the self.  
- **Who Am I?: The Teachings of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi** by Ramana Maharshi, a direct exploration into the process of self-inquiry as taught by the sage.  

**Question for Contemplation:** What does my reaction to the question "Who am I?" reveal about my current state of consciousness and readiness for deeper self-exploration?
