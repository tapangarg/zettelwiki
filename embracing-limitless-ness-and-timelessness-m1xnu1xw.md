**Note 3: The Nature of Limitless-ness**  
**Title:** Embracing Limitless-ness and Timelessness  
**Quote:** "This is true limitless-ness. It is this limitless-ness, timeless-ness, which the mind is trying to mimic through ambition and achievement."  
**Translation into Modern English:** This refers to the authentic experience of being without boundaries or time, which our minds often misinterpret through striving for success and accomplishments.  
**Explanation:** This concept distinguishes between authentic existence and the conditional pursuits prompted by ambition and the ego. True limitless-ness and timelessness imply a state of being beyond the constraints of physical form and the often fleeting nature of societal achievements. The mind's ambition, while it may appear as progress, ultimately restricts our understanding of our boundless nature. By recognizing that genuine fulfillment comes from within, rather than external accomplishments, we can cultivate a more profound experience of life. This realization encourages individuals to explore deeper spiritual avenues, instead of relying solely on material measures of success, thus paving the way for true growth and understanding.  
**Connections:**  
- **Spiritual Abundance:** The understanding that true wealth is inward and not dictated by external circumstances.  
- **Transcendentalism:** A philosophical movement focusing on spiritual and intellectual discovery through nature and the individual connection to the universe.  
- **Mindfulness and Presence:** Practices that anchor one in the present moment, reinforcing the experience of limitless-ness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind** by Yuval Noah Harari, reflecting on the limits imposed by society and how they can obscure our innate potential.  
- **The Wisdom of No Escape** by Pema Chödrön, exploring the insights gained from realizing our inherent completeness.  
- **The Art of Happiness** by the Dalai Lama and Howard Cutler, which discusses happiness as an inner state, unencumbered by external success.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what areas of my life am I overemphasizing ambition and achievement, and how can I shift my focus towards experiencing my inherent limitlessness?
