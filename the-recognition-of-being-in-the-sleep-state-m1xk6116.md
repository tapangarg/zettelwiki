**Note 3:** The Presence of Being  
**Title:** The Recognition of Being in the Sleep State  
**Quote:** "Because this recognition is naturally there; in the sleep state no question about it."  
**Translation into Modern English:** This understanding exists even in a state of sleep; there is no doubt about it.  
**Explanation:** The assertion highlights that recognition of Being persists even when the conscious mind is less active, such as during sleep. This suggests that a deeper dimension of awareness remains intact regardless of state, affirming a continuous presence of Being. This impacts spiritual practices by encouraging individuals to trust that their essential nature is always present, and recognition can arise anywhere, emphasizing that awakening from ignorance to this truth is part of the journey.  
**Connections:**  
- **Lucid Dreaming:** This concept can connect to the practice of lucid dreaming, where awareness persists even during the dream state.  
- **Transcendental Meditation:** A practice aimed at achieving states of deep relaxation and awareness that align with increased recognition of self.  
- **Mystical Experiences:** Various mystical traditions discuss the experience of union with Being during altered states of consciousness, including sleep.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying:** By Sogyal Rinpoche, which examines consciousness, death, and the nature of Being in various states.  
- **Awakening the Mind:** By Daniel Goleman, which discusses the integration of Eastern and Western views on consciousness and awareness.  
- **The Experience of Inner Awareness:** By John M. McTaggart, which explores phenomenology related to perceptions of self and Being.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can recognizing the inherent presence of Being inform your daily awareness and spiritual practice?
