**Note 2: The Role of Emptiness in Self-Inquiry**  
**Title:** Emptiness as the Starting Point of Inquiry  
**Quote:** "The starting point must be this emptiness."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The initial step in any inquiry or contemplation must originate from this state of emptiness.  
**Explanation:** Emptiness here signifies a mental state devoid of attachments and preconceived notions, allowing for genuine inquiry into the nature of self. This state of emptiness becomes crucial, as it serves as the foundational ground for insight and awakening. By beginning our spiritual practices from this place, we avoid becoming overly attached to our identities, our past experiences, or our desires for outcomes. The recognition of emptiness liberates the seeker from the limitations of personal narrative, enabling a deeper exploration of truth. In essence, approaching self-inquiry from emptiness fosters clarity and insight, making it a vital component of any spiritual journey.

- **Zen Buddhism and the Concept of Sunyata (Voidness):** This highlights how emptiness is seen as essential for ultimate understanding.  
- **The Work of Byron Katie:** Her method encourages individuals to question their thoughts, leading to a space of openness and discovery, akin to experiencing emptiness.  
- **Existential Philosophy:** The exploration of nothingness as a core aspect of human experience can relate to this sense of emptiness.  
**Further Reading:**

- **Nothingness: A Philosophical Introduction** by Tracie A. MacKenzie, exploring the existential implications of emptiness in understanding self.  
- **Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism** by Ch√∂gyam Trungpa, which critiques attachment to spiritual practices and insights, emphasizing their emptiness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does starting from a place of emptiness shift the way you engage with both personal inquiry and broader spiritual pursuits?
