**Note 2: The Importance of Inquiry into Self**  
**Title:** The Quest for Hidden Self  
**Quote:** "Who are you before you think about it? Who are you when you just look? Who is looking? Look for this one."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Consider who you are before formulating thoughts about yourself. Who are you when you simply observe? Who is this observer? Seek to uncover this deeper self.  
**Explanation:** This provokes deep reflection on the nature of self-awareness. The questions posed invite individuals to go beyond surface-level self-identification and dive into the depths of self-exploration. It emphasizes the importance of looking inward rather than merely relying on external definitions or expectations. This introspective inquiry sheds light on the often-hidden aspects of our consciousness, leading to a richer understanding of our true essence, beyond constructed identities.  
**Connections:**  
- **Meditative Practices:** Various contemplative practices aim to facilitate this inquiry into self, allowing individuals to witness their thoughts without attachment.  
- **Psychotherapy:** The concept of self-inquiry resonates with therapeutic practices that encourage clients to explore their identities and consciousness.  
- **Philosophy of Mind:** The questions posed align with philosophical discussions about consciousness and the nature of the self in the field of philosophy of mind.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Untethered Soul:** By Michael A. Singer, focusing on the journey toward self-realization and observation of experiences.  
- **The Book of Not Knowing:** By Peter Ralston, which explores the nature of consciousness and self-inquiry.  
- **I Am That:** By Nisargadatta Maharaj, dives into dialogues exploring the concept of self beyond the ego.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does the act of looking within, without preconceived notions, challenge or confirm your understanding of your true self?
