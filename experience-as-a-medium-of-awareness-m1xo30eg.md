Note 2: The Role of Experience in Consciousness  
**Title:** Experience as a Medium of Awareness  
**Quote:** "This experience is Known by what? It is experienced by Consciousness."  
**Translation into Modern English:** What is the essence of this experience? It is recognized and interpreted by the consciousness itself.  
**Explanation:** The speaker emphasizes that every experience—such as tasting a mango or feeling pain—is ultimately perceived by Consciousness. This highlights the role of awareness not as a passive observer but as an active participant in the experience. When we engage deeply with experiences, we tap into a more profound aspect of conscious awareness, enriching our understanding of existence. This realization can promote a more mindful approach to life, where every moment becomes an opportunity for deeper awareness and self-discovery.  
**Connections:**  
- **Awareness and Attention:** The intentional focus on present experiences enhances our conscious engagement with the world.  
- **Consciousness Studies:** Research into the nature of consciousness and subjective experience, examining how experience is interpreted through the lens of awareness.  
- **Embodied Cognition:** A theory that connects our experiences and cognition to our bodily interactions with the environment.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Conscious Mind:** By David J. Chalmers, which explores the philosophical definitions of consciousness.  
- **The Body Keeps the Score:** By Bessel van der Kolk, focusing on how bodily experiences form a part of our consciousness.  
- **Waking Up:** By Sam Harris, providing insights into consciousness, meditation, and the nature of experience.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways does acknowledging the role of consciousness in our experiences transform our understanding of ourselves and the world around us?
