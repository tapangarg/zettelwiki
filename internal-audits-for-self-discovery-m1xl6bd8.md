**Note 3: The Examination of Internal States**  
**Title:** Internal Audits for Self-Discovery  
**Quote:** "Can the body have a relationship? No."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The physical body does not engage in relationships; rather, it is the mind that holds these attachments and perceptions.  
**Explanation:** This statement reflects a profound inquiry into the distinction between the physical and the psychological aspects of our existence. The body, as a vessel, does not experience relationships in the emotional sense; it is our consciousness that creates and engages with these connections. This insight is significant as it prompts individuals to reflect on how their identities and emotional experiences influence the way they perceive relationships. Understanding this separation can lead to a clearer perspective on interpersonal dynamics and self-identity.  
**Connections:**  
- **Mind-Body Dualism:** Philosophical explorations into the nature of consciousness and its separation from the physical body can enhance this understanding.  
- **Psychosomatic Medicine:** Studies that bridge psychological factors with physical health tie into understanding the implications of our thoughts on our bodies.   
- **Social Psychology:** Insights into how beliefs affect behavior can help connect understanding relational dynamics with mental processes.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Mindsight: The New Science of Personal Transformation by Daniel J. Siegel:** A text that unpacks the connection between mind, body, and relationships.  
- **The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma by Bessel van der Kolk:** This book illustrates how our physical body and emotional experiences interact and affect our health and relationships.  
- **Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality by Anthony de Mello:** Explores the awareness of self beyond the physical construct, focusing on the nature of understanding one's true self.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways does my understanding of relationships influence my perception of self and the mind-body connection?
