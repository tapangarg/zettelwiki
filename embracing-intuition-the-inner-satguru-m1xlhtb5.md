**Note 3: The Role of Intuition in Growth**  
**Title:** Embracing Intuition: The Inner Satguru  
**Quote:** "You find your feet are moving in that direction. This is the intuitive."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When we are aligned with our deeper self or the wisdom within, we may naturally start to take actions that feel right without needing to consciously decide.  
**Explanation:** Intuition is often seen as a guiding force that arises when we are in tune with our higher self or deeper intelligence, sometimes referred to as the Satguru. This inner wisdom can guide our actions, leading us instinctively in directions that align with our true purpose. When we learn to trust our intuition, we can navigate life’s complexities with greater confidence and ease. This process requires cultivating a relationship with silence and stillness, where our intuitive insights can emerge. The recognition that our feet, or actions, seem to know the way before our conscious mind does, speaks to the profound capabilities of our inner selves.
