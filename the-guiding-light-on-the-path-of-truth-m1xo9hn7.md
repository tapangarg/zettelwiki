**Note 3: The Role of the Guru**  
**Title:** The Guiding Light on the Path of Truth  
**Quote:** “The Guru actually is the Polar Star around which all things revolve. He is the unmoving one, the core.” ~ Sri Mooji  
**Translation into Modern English:** The Guru serves as a constant and reliable guide amidst the chaos of life, directing us back to the eternal truth that lies within.  
**Explanation:** The Guru, often seen as a teacher or spiritual guide, embodies wisdom and insight, assisting seekers in their journey toward self-realization and enlightenment. The metaphor of the Polar Star illustrates the Guru's unwavering presence, providing direction and support. This relationship encourages the seeker to turn inward, recognizing their innate truth. The teachings imparted by the Guru are not about dogma, but rather about unveiling the deeper essence of the seeker themselves. Establishing a connection with a true Guru can illuminate the path to spiritual awakening, guiding one through the complexities of ego and identity.
