**Note 1: The Nature of Knowing and Awareness**

**Title:** The Limitations of Conventional Knowledge

**Quote:** "Now, if I were to be a bit radical and say that the small ‘k’ knowing, we cannot really testify to it being true; at best, as [Nisargadatta] Maharaj said ‘You can say the only truth that I can say is that ‘I Am’ ..., but ultimately this is not the truth’."

**Translation into Modern English:** To put it boldly, the knowledge we typically cling to ('small k' knowing) cannot be truly validated. The only claim to truth we can make is simply 'I exist,' as articulated by Nisargadatta Maharaj; however, even this statement shouldn't be regarded as the ultimate truth.

**Explanation:** The speaker is emphasizing the distinction between different levels of knowing. The 'small k' knowing refers to our usual understanding of knowledge acquired through experience and intellect, which is transient and incomplete. In contrast, the deeper truth—the 'Truth'—is static and encompasses our fundamental existence ('I Am'). This perspective encourages us to question the validity of our conventional knowledge and explore deeper, existential truths that do not fluctuate with experience.

**Connections:**
- **Nisargadatta Maharaj's Teachings:** Maharaj often distinguished between the ephemeral nature of the mind and the eternal sense of being or 'I Am.'
- **Phenomenology:** A philosophical approach that emphasizes experience and consciousness, which resonates with the concept of exploring deeper awareness beyond conventional knowledge.
- **Eastern Philosophical Traditions:** Many Eastern philosophies (like Advaita Vedanta) stress the importance of recognizing the limitations of intellectual understanding in comprehending ultimate reality.

**Further Reading:**
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, a profound collection of teachings that delve deeper into the idea of 'I Am' and existence.
- **The Heart of Awareness: A Thousand Teachings on Zen** by Pema Chodron, which explores awareness and presence beyond the intellectual grasp.
- **Being and Awareness: The Return to the Truth of Our Experience** by John Tan, which discusses various aspects of being and awareness in spiritual expression. 

**Question for Contemplation:** How can we navigate the space between our conventional knowledge and the deeper awareness of 'I Am' to foster genuine understanding of our existence?
