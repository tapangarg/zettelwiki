**Note 2: Surrender and the End of Intention**  
**Title:** Surrendering to Divine Will: The Paradox of Intention  
**Quote:** "surrender is a dropping of intention itself."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Surrendering means letting go of personal intentions and trusting in a higher power or purpose.  
**Explanation:** The text presents a contrasting perspective on intention through the lens of surrender. When one surrenders, as indicated by the phrase "Everything belongs to my Father. It is his problem," it suggests a relinquishing of personal agendas or intentions. This approach advocates for a profound trust in a greater plan, where personal desires and ambitions are set aside. This paradoxical nature of surrender reveals that true freedom may lie in letting go of the need to control outcomes through individual intentions. In many spiritual traditions, this form of surrender is seen not as defeat but as liberation â€” a pathway to deeper peace and alignment with the universe.

- **The Christian Concept of Trust in God:** Emphasizing faith and surrendering to divine will, allowing for a life guided by spiritual rather than personal ambitions.  
- **Buddhist Non-Attachment:** The practice of releasing desires and attachments to outcomes, leading to tranquility and enlightenment.
