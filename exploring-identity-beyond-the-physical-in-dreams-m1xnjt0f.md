**Note 1: The Nature of Self in Dream States**  
**Title:** Exploring Identity Beyond the Physical in Dreams  
**Quote:** "But basically, this dream is only seen by me... it’s taking everything inside this ‘me’ but the ‘I Am-ness’ is felt only in the particular character in the dream body that is my dream body."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Essentially, the dream is a personal experience that belongs solely to me; it absorbs everything related to me while the feeling of 'I Am-ness' is exclusively identified with my dream persona.  
**Explanation:** This excerpt delves into the complex nature of identity, particularly as it shifts between states of wakefulness and dreaming. It highlights how, during dreaming, the physical body is absent from our conscious experience, yet there exists a dream body in which an individual identifies with a sense of 'I Am-ness.' The recognition of this 'I Am-ness' being localized in a singular character within the dream underscores the subjective nature of reality. The dream becomes a privy experience that caters solely to the dreamer, indicating the profound distinction between the self and the external world. This exploration is significant as it sheds light on how we can begin to discern our experiences and identities separate from the physical realm. Understanding this distinction can lead to deeper insights regarding consciousness, self-awareness, and the metaphysical nature of existence.
