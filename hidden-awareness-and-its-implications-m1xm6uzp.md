**Note 2: The Nature of Overlooked Awareness**  
**Title:** Hidden Awareness and Its Implications  
**Quote:** "That which was overlooked. When I say ‘I am not aware of awareness’..., I am aware of awareness otherwise why would I say that?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** The speaker recognizes an irony in that while they claim an unawareness of their own awareness, the very act of making that claim suggests an inherent awareness.  
**Explanation:** This statement reveals the intricate relationship between awareness and the subconscious. It brings to light the phenomena where our ability to articulate experiences can serve as a paradox of knowledge—essentially suggesting that unawareness can only exist within a context of awareness. This reflects upon the human condition whereby insights about our consciousness can feel profoundly obvious once recognized, yet remain hidden until prompted by deeper inquiry. This understanding not only contributes to personal enlightenment but also the communal human experience of grappling with the nature of consciousness.  
**Connections:**  
- **Cognitive Dissonance:** The concept that suggests individuals experience mental discomfort due to holding conflicting beliefs or attitudes, akin to holding the awareness of non-awareness.  
- **The Socratic Paradox:** The idea that claiming to know nothing is a form of wisdom since it denotes awareness of one's limitations.  
- **Lucid Dreaming:** Memory and awareness during dreaming states provide a parallel inquiry into how individuals can have divergent levels of awareness during different states of consciousness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality** by Anthony de Mello, which discusses the significance of conscious living and awareness.  
- **The Mind Illuminated: A Complete Meditation Guide Integrating Buddhist Wisdom and Brain Science** by Culadasa (John Yates) and Matthew Immergut, which provides insight into awareness practice through meditation.  
- **Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion** by Sam Harris, which examines consciousness and awareness from a secular perspective.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can recognizing the layers of our awareness impact our interactions with ourselves and others in everyday life?
