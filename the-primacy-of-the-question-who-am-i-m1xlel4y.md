**Note 1: Understanding the Question of Existence**  
**Title:** The Primacy of the Question "Who Am I?"  
**Quote:** "Actually, the question ‘Who am I?’ takes precedence over everything else."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The inquiry into one's true identity is of the utmost importance and underlies all other considerations.  

**Explanation:** This statement emphasizes the foundational role of self-inquiry in the journey of understanding oneself. The question "Who am I?" is not merely philosophical but a vital exploration that invites deeper reflection on one's identity beyond societal labels and conditioned responses. Discovering the true essence of oneself is a transformative endeavor that leads to liberation from the constraints of ego and preconceptions. In the context of growth and understanding, this inquiry can reveal layers of one's existence that may have been overlooked, promoting a profound awareness of the self and emphasizing the interconnectedness of all beings.
