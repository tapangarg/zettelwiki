Note 1: The Union of the Soul with the Divine

**Title:** The Innermost Chamber: Union of the Soul and the Divine

**Quote:** "In the innermost chamber of my Heart.. My soul merges into Him"

**Translation into Modern English:** In the deepest part of one's heart, the soul unites with the Divine.

**Explanation:** This phrase reflects the mystical concept where the soul finds its ultimate union with the Divine presence. This is often considered the pinnacle of spiritual experience, where the individual's essence converges with a higher reality, suggesting a profound state of enlightenment and serene fulfillment. The Heart is metaphorically the sacred space within, where this divine encounter transpires.

**Connections:**
- **Mystical Union:** In various mystical traditions, this concept is recognized as the ultimate goal of the spiritual journey.
- **Heart as the Spiritual Center:** Many spiritual teachings highlight the heart as the seat of the soul and the primary medium of divine connection.
- **Ego Transcendence:** This merging emphasizes the dissolution of the ego and personal will into the greater divine will.

**Further Reading:**
- **The Interior Castle** by St. Teresa of Avila, where the innermost chamber of the soul is explored in the journey towards divine union.
- **The Heart of Centering Prayer: Nondual Christianity in Theory and Practice** by Cynthia Bourgeault, examining the heart as a spiritual center.
- **The Upanishads**, particularly those exploring Atman (the soul) and Brahman (the ultimate reality).

**Question for Contemplation:** How can we cultivate our innermost chamber to welcome the merging of our soul with the divine presence?
