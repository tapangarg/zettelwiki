**Note 2: The Doer-ship of Ego**  
**Title:** The Illusion of Agency and Doer-ship  
**Quote:** "After ‘What’s in it for me?’ it is ‘What should I do? What should I do?’ Doer-ship. We cannot find this ‘me’, we cannot find the doer, but it still wants to know ‘What should I do?’"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Following the self-oriented question of personal benefit, the next instantiation of the ego is the compulsion to dictate actions, seeking external validation or purpose in doing, despite the inability to locate the true self or doer.  
**Explanation:** This concept exemplifies how the ego maintains its presence by instigating the notion of 'doer-ship,' where actions become synonymous with identity. Behind this drive lies the need to assert control and direction in life, showcasing how deeply entrenched the ego is in our perception of existence. Here, doer-ship indicates an incessant desire to perform, execute, and fulfill roles that contribute to the sense of self. Even as the individual grapples with identity dissolution, there remains the critical question of action to elude the void left by the absence of 'me.' Recognizing this duality of desire and action provides significant insight into the ego's sustaining mechanisms, indicating a need for conscious awareness around motivations and decision-making processes.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Role of Intention in Action:** Many philosophical and spiritual frameworks emphasize acting with awareness over identification with the doer.  
- **Existentialism and Responsibility:** Existential thinkers like Sartre discuss the pressure of human agency and the created identity through choices, further complicating the doer-ship concept.  
- **Buddhist Law of Karma:** Understanding the principle that actions lead to consequences can align with releasing attachment to the outcomes of those actions and the doer itself.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Tao of Pooh by Benjamin Hoff:** A simplistic yet profound exploration of how non-action (wu wei) can lead to deeper understanding and integration with life.  
- **Living Buddha, Living Christ by Thich Nhat Hanh:** This text integrates Buddhist and Christian thought on accepting one's actions without egoic attachment.  
- **The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself by Michael A. Singer:** A guide to liberating oneself from ego-identification and the compulsion for doer-ship.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can you differentiate between actions taken from an authentic self-awareness versus those driven by the need to define or assert 'self' through doing?
