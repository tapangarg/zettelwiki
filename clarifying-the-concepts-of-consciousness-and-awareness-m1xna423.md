**Note 1: Distinctions Between Consciousness and Awareness**  
**Title:** Clarifying the Concepts of Consciousness and Awareness  
**Quote:** "We say ‘Now there is an Awareness of Consciousness. And in sleep state there was just Awareness’."  
**Translation into Modern English:** We refer to a state where there is an awareness directed at consciousness, while in states of deep sleep, awareness exists in a more pure form, devoid of consciousness.  
**Explanation:** The author is drawing a distinction between two terms often used interchangeably: 'Consciousness' and 'Awareness.' The statement suggests that in normal waking life, we have an awareness that is aware of consciousness itself, which encompasses thoughts, feelings, and experiences. In deep sleep, however, this awareness is untainted—it's simply present, devoid of the complexities that come with consciousness. This differentiation can clarify our understanding of various states of being and the progression towards deeper levels of self-awareness and meditation. Recognizing the subtle differences between these concepts can lead to profound insights into our existence and the nature of reality.  
**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** The differentiation between awareness and consciousness is pivotal in many mindfulness practices where one seeks to enhance awareness of the present moment.
- **States of Consciousness:** This concept aligns with discussions about altered states of consciousness, including dreaming and sleep, and their significance in spiritual traditions.
- **Non-Dual Awareness:** The notion of pure awareness resonates with non-dual philosophies, which suggest that true enlightenment involves recognizing the limitations of consciousness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Untethered Soul:** By Michael A. Singer, which explores the distinction between consciousness and a sense of self.
- **Being Aware of Being Aware:** By John de Ruiter, which dives into the nature of awareness and presence.
- **Observing the Mind:** By J. Krishnamurti, which examines the relationship between thought, consciousness, and awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does the understanding of pure awareness enhance our meditation practice, and what shifts occur in our perception of self when we explore the nuances between consciousness and awareness?
