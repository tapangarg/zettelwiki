**Note 1: The Nature of Knowing**  
**Title:** Understanding What It Means to “Know”  
**Quote:** "What is it that we mean by ‘knowing’? … when we say, usually, that ‘I know something’..., aren’t we talking about the concept of something, which is the description of something or a visual/mental representation of something?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** What does it mean when we refer to our understanding as 'knowing'? Often, this term implies that we are referencing a concept or an idea that is represented in our minds.  
**Explanation:** The discussion on knowing invites a deeper inquiry into our understanding of knowledge itself. When we declare that we 'know' something, we often mean that we possess a mental construct—a description or image—that we associate with our experience. Conversely, when we say 'I don’t know,' we may be expressing a state of being present without mental clutter or preconceived notions. This distinction is important because it underscores the difference between intellectual knowledge (what we can describe or visualize) and experiential knowledge (the sensation of being present without the burden of memory or thought). This insight encourages individuals to reflect on their subjective experiences versus the objective understanding and can lead to a more profound clarity in communication and perception.  
**Connections:**  
- **Epistemology:** The branch of philosophy concerned with the nature and scope of knowledge and belief.  
- **Mindfulness:** The practice of being present and fully engaging with the current experience, allowing for a clearer understanding of 'not knowing.'  
- **Constructivist Learning Theory:** The perspective that knowledge is not a passive receiving of information but a construct built through experiences and interactions.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **What Is Knowledge?** by Rachel Zuckert, which explores different theories of knowledge and their implications.  
- **The Structure of Scientific Revolutions** by Thomas S. Kuhn, which delves into how knowledge evolves and how paradigms shape our understanding.  
- **Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Finding Peace in a Frantic World** by Mark Williams and Danny Penman, which discusses the importance of being present in enhancing self-awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does the distinction between intellectual understanding and experiential knowing affect the way we engage with our environments and relationships?
