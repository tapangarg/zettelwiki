**Note 3: The Presence as God**  

**Title:** The Divine Nature of Presence  
**Quote:** "This Presence is the God of the waking state and the dream state."  
**Translation into Modern English:** This unchanging Presence is akin to a divine essence present in both our waking life and dreams.  

**Explanation:** This statement posits that the essence of our existence, referred to here as Presence, embodies a divine quality transcending ordinary experiences. It highlights the idea that regardless of whether we are fully awake or immersed in dreams, there exists a constant and sacred element of our being that connects us to a higher state of awareness. Understanding Presence as a facet of the divine invites a transformative perspective on everyday experiences and encourages individuals to recognize divinity within themselves and the world around them.
