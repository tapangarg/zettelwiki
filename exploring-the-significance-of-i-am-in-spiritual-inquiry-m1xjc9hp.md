**Note 2: The Concept of ‘I Am’**

**Title:** Exploring the Significance of ‘I Am’ in Spiritual Inquiry

**Quote:** "‘I Am’ is a portal that can go both ways." 

**Translation into Modern English:** The phrase ‘I Am’ serves as a gateway that can lead to both personal identity and the recognition of one's true existence beyond that identity.

**Explanation:** The phrase ‘I Am’ serves dual purposes in spiritual inquiry. On one hand, it signifies the awareness associated with personal identity—who you think you are—inherent with all the complexities of personality and ego. On the other hand, it offers an entry point to a deeper truth—the acknowledgment of existence that transcends personal characteristics and thoughts. This duality means that by exploring ‘I Am’ through self-inquiry, one can unravel layers of identity and illuminate the underlying essence of being. This realization is pivotal for spiritual seekers aiming for liberation from the confines of ego consciousness.

**Connections:**
- **The Concept of Being in Existential Philosophy:** Existential thinkers like Martin Heidegger have examined the significance of being and how self-awareness shapes our existence.
- **The Role of Affirmations:** In self-help and psychological practices, affirmations often utilize ‘I Am’ statements to reinforce positive self-identity, paralleling the intrinsic nature of spiritual inquiry.
- **Buddhist Notion of Anatta:** This correlates with the Buddhist concept of ‘non-self,’ emphasizing the illusion of fixed identity and the fluid nature of existence.

**Further Reading:**
- **The Untethered Soul:** By Michael A. Singer, which offers insights into transcending the ego through self-awareness.
- **A Course in Miracles:** This spiritual text emphasizes the transformative power of perception and awareness, particularly around the concept of ‘I Am.’

**Question for Contemplation:** What does it mean for you to explore the phrase ‘I Am’ as it relates to your understanding of self and your true nature?
