**Note 2: The Paradox of Inquiry**  
**Title:** The Role of Inquiry in Understanding Ego's Non-Existence  
**Quote:** "What is the need to inquire then?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Why should we ask questions if there is no real ego to question?  
**Explanation:** This paradox presented in the text invites deep reflection. It asks why we would engage in inquiry if the presumed subject of our inquiry—an existing ego—does not exist in a fundamental sense. The process of inquiry is emphasized not primarily for the sake of uncovering the ego but rather as a method to unearth deeper truths about our existence beyond the surface-level beliefs we hold. Inquiry allows us to confront our attachments, doubts, and fears, demonstrating that even in realizing there is no ego, the engagement with this concept is itself illuminating. It's through this act of questioning that we can move toward a profound understanding of what it means to exist beyond our attachments to identity and the narratives we create.
