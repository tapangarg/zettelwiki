**Note 1: The Complexity of the 'I' Self**

**Title:** Unpacking the Complexity of 'I Am'

**Quote:** “By making ‘I’ into the sense ‘I Am’ ... the attribute of seeking something; then this ‘I Am’ that was unassociated now became ‘I am a seeker’.”

**Translation into Modern English:** When we try to define ourselves as 'I' and adopt the idea of 'I Am', we complicate our understanding by associating it with being a seeker or attaching qualities to it, thus transforming the pure essence of 'I’ into something that is heavily laden with definitions and attributes.

**Explanation:** The “I” represents the core of our being, yet when we start to conceptualize it as 'I Am', we inadvertently complicate its simplicity. This understanding shifts from merely existing ('I') to a more entangled self-perception where we attach various identities and roles, like 'I am a seeker', ‘I am good’, or ‘I am terrible’. These attributes, while they may help us navigate the world, can lead us away from the fundamental truth of who we are. Ultimately, we are seeking a deeper understanding of the true 'I' that exists beyond these layers of description. The significance of this realization lies in the recognition that by dropping these attachments, we can glimpse a purer state of being that is free from the constraints of identity, allowing for personal growth and a clearer understanding of our existence.

**Connections:** 
- **Non-Duality:** The concept of non-duality teaches that our true essence transcends individual identities and attributes.
- **Ego and Identity:** Exploring how the ego constructs identity through a collection of beliefs and societal roles, which ultimately limits personal growth.
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques in mindfulness that encourage letting go of self-identifying labels can lead to deeper self-awareness.

- **I Am That by Nisargadatta Maharaj** - A collection of teachings on non-duality and the nature of the self.
- **Be Here Now by Ram Dass** - A call to present-moment awareness and letting go of the 'I' constructs.

**Question for Contemplation:** How might releasing our attachments to identities and attributes help us connect with our true essence and transform our understanding of self?
