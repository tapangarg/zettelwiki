**Note 3: The Nature of Existence**  
**Title:** Understanding the 'I Am' Experience  
**Quote:** "Can you be the sense that ‘I Am, I exist?’ Can you be that? Is it clear what this means, the sense ‘I Am’?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Are you able to identify with the fundamental awareness that simply states 'I exist'? Do you comprehend the significance of this awareness?  
**Explanation:** The 'I Am' experience represents a profound recognition of existence itself, distinct from the fleeting thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations that typically occupy our minds. This awareness is foundational and represents a return to a more essential state of being, free from societal definitions and expectations. Realizing we are 'I Am' highlights the idea that existence is not contingent upon external validations but is an inherent state of awareness. This idea fosters personal and spiritual growth since it invites individuals to connect with a deeper layer of existence where peace and authenticity reside. Recognizing oneself as this awareness allows for an integration into a more universal conception of self, promoting harmony and unity with all of existence.  
**Connections:**

- **Advaita Vedanta:** A non-dualistic tradition in Hindu philosophy that emphasizes the unity of self and ultimate reality.

- **The Heart of the Buddha’s Teaching:** By Thich Nhat Hanh, covering the essence of mindfulness and awareness.  
- **Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality:** By Anthony de Mello, focusing on the importance of awareness in everyday life.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing the 'I Am' experience change your interaction with the world around you and shape your understanding of reality?
