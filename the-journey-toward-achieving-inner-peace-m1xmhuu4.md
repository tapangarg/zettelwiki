**Translation into Modern English:** The statement suggests that attaining true peace involves understanding deeper truths rather than just surface-level tranquility.

While temporary moments of tranquility can be sought through various means, they may not result in genuine peace unless rooted in the deeper, unchanging aspects of existence. Understanding this distinction is significant in personal development, as it encourages individuals to engage in practices that foster a connection with the more profound aspects of reality, leading to sustained peace and insight. This exploration might involve quiet contemplation, spiritual practices, or philosophical inquiry into the nature of existence, thereby enabling us to cultivate a stable inner state that remains unaffected by external changes.
