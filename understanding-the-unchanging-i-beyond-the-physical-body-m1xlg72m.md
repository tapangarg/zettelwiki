**Note 1: The Nature of the Constant 'I'**  
**Title:** Understanding the Unchanging 'I' Beyond the Physical Body  
**Quote:** "h is this ‘I’ which remains constant through the dropping and the picking up of even these bodies?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** What is this 'I' that stays consistent amid the changes of our physical forms?  
**Explanation:** The question emphasizes the search for a core sense of self that is unaltered by our physical existence. This exploration encourages individuals to consider their identity beyond mere physical attributes. The acknowledgment that one cannot merely identify with the body, as it is transient and subject to change, provokes a deeper inquiry into the essence of being. The references to spiritual teachers Ramana Maharshi and Nisargadatta Maharaj invite contemplation on how we perceive our existence and essence.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality:** The philosophical perspective asserting that the self is fundamentally one with the universe, often explored in Advaita Vedanta.  
- **Self-Inquiry:** A practice popularized by Ramana Maharshi, encouraging individuals to ask themselves, “Who am I?” to discover the true self.  
- **Mind-Body Distinction:** The exploration of dualism versus physicalist approaches in understanding consciousness and identity.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, a compilation of teachings that revolves around the understanding of 'I Am' as the essence of self.  
- **Who Am I? (The Advaita Philosophy)** by Ramana Maharshi, detailing the inquiry into the nature of the self.  
- **The Power of Now** by Eckhart Tolle, which discusses presence and the sense of being beyond the physical.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can deepening our understanding of the unchanging 'I' influence our perception of life and the transient nature of our physical existence?
