**Note 1: The Beauty of Starting with Uncertainty**  
**Title:** Embracing the Unknown as a Path to Inquiry  
**Quote:** "I don’t know... That is a beautiful place to start the inquiry."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Admitting ignorance can be a profound and fruitful starting point for exploration and learning.  
**Explanation:** This moment underscores the importance of acknowledging what we don’t know as a vital step in the process of inquiry. Stating “I don’t know” allows us to remain open-minded and receptive to new insights and perspectives. It invites curiosity and the potential for growth. Admitting ignorance fosters a mindset that values questions over assertions, creating opportunities for deeper understanding rather than simply reinforcing preconceived beliefs. By beginning from a position of unknowing, we open ourselves to the richness of exploration and discovery.
