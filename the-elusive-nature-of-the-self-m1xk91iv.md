**Note 1: The Frustration of Seeking the Self**  
**Title:** The Elusive Nature of the Self  
**Quote:** "Because we are looking for the Self as if it is some object to be found, either within the body or outside the body somewhere. It is not that."  
**Explanation:** The text emphasizes that the self or true identity cannot be perceived as an object to be searched for, either externally or within one's physical form. Many individuals feel disillusioned and frustrated in their spiritual journeys because they approach self-discovery as a quest for an object, rather than an exploration of awareness. The recognition that the essence of self is not an entity but a realization leads to a more profound understanding of existence. This distinction is critical; it shifts the focus from searching externally to cultivating awareness of the self as an ongoing process of consciousness.  
**Connections:**  
- **Eastern Philosophies and Non-Duality:** Many Eastern traditions suggest that the self is not a singular object but rather a state of awareness, as seen in Advaita Vedanta.  
- **Existentialism:** Engaging with existential philosophy can deepen one's understanding of identity and the human experience beyond the notion of an objectified self.  
- **Mindfulness and Awareness Practices:** Mindfulness encourages a shift from identifying with thoughts and experiences to recognizing the observer behind those thoughts.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"I Am That" by Nisargadatta Maharaj** - A classic text that explores the nature of self and reality from a non-dual perspective.  
- **"The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle** - Discusses being present and recognizing the true self beyond thoughts and identities.  
- **"The Untethered Soul" by Michael A. Singer** - Explores the idea of consciousness and the self beyond external identifications.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What is the distinction between seeking the self as an object and recognizing it as an awareness, and how does this understanding alter the nature of our spiritual journeys?
