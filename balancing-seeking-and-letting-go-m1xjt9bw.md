**Note 2: Seeking and Effort in Spiritual Growth**  
**Title:** Balancing Seeking and Letting Go  
**Quote:** "We must not drop the seeking prematurely. We will know in our heart, we will know clearly: Am I free or not from suffering?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** It is crucial not to abandon the process of seeking too soon; we will come to an inner awareness that determines our freedom from suffering.  

**Explanation:** This note highlights the delicate balance between the active pursuit of understanding and the eventual relinquishment of effort. The author emphasizes that seeking is a vital step in spiritual growth, as it cultivates clarity to recognize oneâ€™s true state regarding suffering. However, the notion of seeking should evolve into an experience that is free, where the truth of one's situation becomes apparent. The promotion of this discernment is essential, as it could differentiate between those who are genuinely progressing on their spiritual path versus those who are superficially engaging. Once clarity is achieved that transcends intellectual engagement, one can drop the relentless effort and simply exist in the moment, appreciating the natural ebb and flow of life.
