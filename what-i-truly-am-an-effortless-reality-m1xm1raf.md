**Note 4: The Essence of Being**  
**Title:** What I Truly Am: An Effortless Reality  
**Quote:** "You cannot say that ‘What I truly Am is tired’. Because it is effortless to be aware. It IS what I Am..., even before I Am."  
**Translation into Modern English:** One cannot claim that their true essence experiences tiredness because awareness itself is inherently effortless and exists beyond any sense of self.   
**Explanation:** This profound statement disentangles awareness from the fabrications of personal experiences. It asserts that our true self, the essence of being, is untouched by physical states or emotional fluctuations. The awareness that resides within is timeless, existing prior to the constructed identities we claim in life. It sheds light on the difference between our transient experiences—such as fatigue—and our profound nature of being, which is always vibrant and alive. Recognizing this can lead to great peace, as we no longer identify with the tiredness of the body or the stresses of the mind. Instead, we view these states as temporary phases that do not diminish our true essence, allowing us to find solace in the simplicity of just being.  
**Connections:**

- **The Perennial Philosophy:** Various spiritual traditions present a unified view of reality that posits a timeless essence behind all existence.
