Note 2: Appreciating the Overlooked through Art

**Title:** Art as a Catalyst for Seeing the Unseen

**Quote:** "What art invites us to do, to pause and look at what we see every day, but never take the time to contemplate."

**Translation into Modern English:** Art encourages us to pause and truly observe the things we overlook in everyday life.

**Explanation:** Art serves as a vehicle that allows us to transcend the ordinary, prompting us to look closely at the mundane with fresh eyes. By doing so, it challenges us to find beauty and depth in the commonplace, urging an appreciation for details we normally neglect. This act of pausing cultivates awareness and can lead to a heightened sense of appreciation for beauty in our daily lives. In Monet's works, common scenes like train stations and factories become subjects of contemplation, demonstrating that art trains us to see and appreciate what's around us when we consciously give it our attention.

**Connections:**
- **Impressionism Movement:** Monet’s work is a core aspect of this movement, which focuses on capturing light and ordinary moments.
- **Zen and the Art of Seeing:** The practice of seeing things as they truly are, without assumptions.
- **Phenomenology:** The philosophical study of structures of experience and consciousness, encouraging immersion in life’s moments.

**Further Reading:**
- **“Ways of Seeing” by John Berger:** Examines how we view art and the world.
- **"What Are You Looking At?: The Surprising, Shocking, and Sometimes Strange Story of 150 Years of Modern Art" by Will Gompertz:** Offers insights into how art can change perceptions.
- **"The Art of Seeing" by Aldous Huxley:** Discusses how art alters perception.

**Question for Contemplation:** What elements in your everyday environment have you become indifferent to, and how might you reclaim an appreciation for their beauty through intentional contemplation?

Questions. The purpose of a bridge is to convey us from one place to another. Stopping upon a bridge is symbolic of a contemplative stance toward life; it is choosing to pause and to drink in the beauty of the moment. Several years ago I saw an exhibition of paintings by Monet. I was struck by the fact that the subject matter of many of his paintings was of train stations, factories, and constructions sites. One painting entitled The Train, which showed a train in the foreground and numerous factories belching out clouds of black smoke in the background, occasioned one author to comment, “The site in this picture looks more like Gary, Indiana than anything traditionally associated with Impressionistic France.”12 How strange that people would take time to come to a museum and stand in front of a painting depicting such a commonplace sight! But is not this one example of what art invites us to do, to pause and look at what we see every day, but never take the time to contemplate? What are the “Westminster bridges” of your daily round that contain the “morning dew” of God’s beauty? Have you become blasé to them because you have not taken time to pause and look?
