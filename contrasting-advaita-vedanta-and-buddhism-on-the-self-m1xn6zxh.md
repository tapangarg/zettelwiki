**Note 3: The Distinction between Advaita and Buddhism**  
**Title:** Contrasting Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism on the Self  
**Quote:** "The whole distinction... a big part of the distinction between Vedanta, traditional Advaita Vedanta, and Buddhism was this."  
**Translation into Modern English:** A significant difference exists between traditional Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism regarding their interpretations of the self.  
**Explanation:** This commentary points to the nuances in how Advaita and Buddhism conceptualize the self. In Advaita, there is an emphasis on the realization of the true Self ('Atman') that exists beyond the ego and the temporary manifestations of the body-mind. Conversely, Buddhism fundamentally teaches the concept of No-Self (Anatta), which denies any permanent, unchanging self. Understanding these contrasting perspectives is crucial for anyone on a spiritual path, as it shapes their views on identity, existence, and liberation. The engagement between these two philosophies offers deep insights into the nature of reality, bringing forth discussions about the nature of suffering, liberation, and the ultimate purpose of spiritual practice.
