**Note 2: The Danger of Identification with Experiences**  
**Title:** The Pitfall of Claiming Specialness Post-Awareness  
**Quote:** "The trouble with awakening experiences is that if, after it is over, you say ‘Oh, I am special because this happened to me’. Then you’ve picked up the ‘person’ again."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The issue with awakening experiences arises when an individual begins to identify as 'special' because of such moments; this reinstates the sense of individual self or ego that was meant to be transcended.  
**Explanation:** This line highlights a significant risk in the spiritual journey—becoming attached to one's experiences of awakening. The moment one claims to be unique or special because of their experiences, they re-establish the very identity that they sought to dissolve through their spiritual work. This pattern can lead to spiritual ego, where an individual may feel superior to others based on their experiences, thus creating division rather than unity. Spiritual growth requires constant awareness and the ability to let go, maintaining humility and openness to learning.  
**Connections:**  
- **Spiritual Materialism:** Chögyam Trungpa's concept where spiritual experiences and insights can be appropriated as a means of reinforcing the ego's illusions.  
- **Non-Dual Awareness:** The understanding that all experiences are part of a larger reality that transcends personal identity, fostering a sense of interconnectedness.  
- **The role of Community in Spiritual Growth:** Engaging with spiritual communities that emphasize humility can help prevent the pitfalls associated with individualism in spiritual practices.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism** by Chögyam Trungpa, which addresses the dangers of ego in spiritual practice.  
- **Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life** by Marshall B. Rosenberg, which promotes understanding and connection over competition and separation.  
- **The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself** by Michael A. Singer, which explores observing oneself as a way to disengage from ego-centered thinking.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can we ensure that our spiritual experiences foster connection rather than division within ourselves and with others?
