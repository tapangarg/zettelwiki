**Note 3: The Awareness of Thought**  
**Title:** The Experience of ‘Not Thinking’  
**Quote:** "Isn’t it also Known that ‘Right now, I don’t have a thought.'"  
**Translation into Modern English:** It's recognized that sometimes we can be aware of the absence of thought.  
**Explanation:** This idea highlights an important aspect of consciousness—the capacity to recognize the absence of thought. This state can represent clarity or a meditative awareness where the mind is not actively engaged in discourse or processing information. It suggests an often overlooked form of knowing that isn’t reliant on the continuous stream of thoughts that can clutter the mind. Acknowledging when we are “not thinking” allows us to appreciate moments of stillness and presence, emphasizing the value of silence and the potential richness that lies in awareness untainted by incessant mental chatter.
