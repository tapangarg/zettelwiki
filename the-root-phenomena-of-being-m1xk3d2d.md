**Note 3: The Experience of Being**

**Title:** The Root Phenomena of Being

**Quote:** "The sense of Being is phenomenally perceived." 

**Translation into Modern English:** The experience of existence itself is something that we can perceptively understand on a sensory level.

**Explanation:** The speaker highlights the palpable feeling of 'Being,' which is often more readily accessible than conceptual awareness. The direct experience of existence serves as a foundational aspect of our perception. While awareness may seem abstract, the sense of being is a core phenomenon we all engage with everyday. This phenomenon is significant as it grounds us in our lived experiences, thus creating a tangible connection between consciousness and existence. Recognizing this sense of being can serve as an anchor for deeper explorations into awareness itself.

**Connections:**
- **Existential Philosophy:** This branch of philosophy often discusses the essence of being and existence, exploring humanity's place within it.
- **Embodiment Practices:** Certain spiritual practices focus on the bodyâ€™s experience of being, promoting awareness through physical sensations.
- **Transcendentalism:** This idea encourages individuals to connect deeply with their own experience and consciousness as a pathway to understanding existence.

**Further Reading:**
- **"Being and Time" by Martin Heidegger:** A complex exploration of being that emphasizes our relationship with existence.
- **"The Tao of Pooh" by Benjamin Hoff:** Uses the character of Winnie the Pooh to explain Taoist principles of being and consciousness in a relatable way.
- **"I Am That" by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj:** Offers insights into non-duality and the immediacy of being and awareness.

**Question for Contemplation:** How does the experience of simply being influence my understanding of awareness and my interaction with the world around me?
