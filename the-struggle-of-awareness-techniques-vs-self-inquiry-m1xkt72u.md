**Note 1: The Inner Tug-of-War Between Techniques and Inquiry**  
**Title:** The Struggle of Awareness: Techniques vs. Self-Inquiry  
**Quote:** "I keep shifting between the convenient realities... I get confused between going by techniques or going by the inquiry of ‘Who am I?’"  
**Translation into Modern English:** I fluctuate between adopting convenient approaches to my practice and engaging deeply with the self-inquiry of ‘Who am I?’ which sometimes causes confusion in my spiritual journey.  
**Explanation:** The speaker describes a common experience among spiritual seekers: navigating the differing methodologies available—techniques for achieving mindfulness or spiritual insights and the profound question of self-inquiry. This dynamic creates an internal tension as one seeks to attain peace yet grapples with the complexities of maintaining that state. Techniques may offer temporary relief or structure, while self-inquiry pulls one into a more profound understanding of identity and consciousness. Thus, recognizing this struggle is pivotal to progressing on the spiritual path, as it suggests the need for balance and discernment in one's choices.  
**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness Techniques:** Many meditation practices emphasize techniques that can inadvertently lead to temporary states of ease without deeper insight.  
- **Self-Inquiry in Advaita Vedanta:** The philosophy encourages continuous questioning of the nature of self, highlighting that true peace comes with the realization of one’s identity beyond the ego.  
- **Spiritual Bypassing:** The tendency to misuse spiritual practices to avoid confronting deeper emotional or psychological issues may arise when relying solely on techniques.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle** - This book delves into the importance of being present and the pitfalls of overattachment to methodologies.  
- **I Am That by Nisargadatta Maharaj** - A classic on Advaita Vedanta that provides guidance on the inquiry of self.  
- **The Heart of Awareness by Adyashanti** - This work explores the freedom found in self-inquiry and presence.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can I find a balance between using techniques and engaging in self-inquiry to deepen my understanding of myself and cultivate lasting peace?
