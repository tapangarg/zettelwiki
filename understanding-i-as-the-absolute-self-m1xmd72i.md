**Note 2: The Nature of 'I' as the Absolute**  
**Title:** Understanding 'I' as the Absolute Self  
**Quote:** "How is this ‘I’ the truth of what I Am, the Absolute? This Awareness is also called the Self on this path."  
**Translation into Modern English:** We must explore how the sense of ‘I’ represents the fundamental truth of my existence, or the Absolute Self, with this Awareness being synonymous with the Self in our spiritual path.  
**Explanation:** The inquiry into the nature of 'I' reveals its centrality in spiritual understanding. The text underscores that the 'I' is not merely a personal identity but reflects the deeper, universal essence of existence— the Absolute. This Awareness, which is aware of itself, is critical because it ties personal experience to a universal reality. The exploration of 'I' as the Self invites individuals to dismantle their attachments to the ego and identity, fostering a deeper understanding of being that transcends dualistic perceptions. Recognizing 'I' as the Absolute has profound implications for personal growth, allowing for a release of misconceptions about selfhood and leading to a more expansive consciousness.  
**Connections:**

- **Self-Inquiry Practices:** Techniques used in various traditions, notably by Ramana Maharshi, focus on questioning the nature of 'I' to unveil the deeper Self.  
- **Buddhist Concept of Anatta:** The idea of 'no-self' challenges conventional ideas of identity, providing a counterpoint to this exploration of ‘I’.
