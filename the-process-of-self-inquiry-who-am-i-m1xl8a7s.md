**Note 2: The Inquiry of Self**  
**Title:** The Process of Self-Inquiry: “Who am I?”  
**Quote:** "the inquiry (as Bhagavan [Ramana Maharshi] said) ‘Who am I?’ will become easier and easier, and clearer and clearer."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The process of self-inquiry, as taught by Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, becomes progressively simpler and clearer as one engages with it.  
**Explanation:** Self-inquiry is a powerful tool for self-discovery, founded on the question "Who am I?". This question points beyond conventional identities and roles, leading to deeper insights regarding our existence. By consistently engaging in this inquiry, practitioners can peel back layers of conditioned belief and societal constructs, ultimately revealing the true essence of their being. This method is significant not just for spiritual growth but also for cultivating mental clarity and emotional stability. As one gains clarity through inquiry, layers of confusion or self-doubt can dissolve, providing a more profound sense of peace and understanding regarding the nature of self and reality.
