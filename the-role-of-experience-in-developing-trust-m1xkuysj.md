**Note 2: Trust as an Evolving Experience**  
**Title:** The Role of Experience in Developing Trust  
**Quote:** "As you see some things really work then more trust gets developed."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When you observe certain teachings or practices yielding positive results, your trust in those ideas naturally increases.  

**Explanation:** The acknowledgment of experiential learning is crucial when it comes to developing trust in spiritual teachings. The speaker suggests that it’s through personal validation of concepts and practices that trust blossoms. This highlights the importance of active engagement and openness to experimentation within one’s spiritual journey. When individuals witness the tangible benefits of spiritual practices, it can shift their mindset, allowing for a gradual increase in trust. This section underscores the idea that trust isn’t static but is a dynamic process that evolves with personal growth and insight.
