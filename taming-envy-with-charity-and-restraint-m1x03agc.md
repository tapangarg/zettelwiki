Note 3: Overcoming Envy Through Restraint and Kindness

**Title:** Taming Envy with Charity and Restraint 

**Quote:** "As our mothers told us when we were children, 'If you can’t say anything good about another person then don’t say anything at all.' Exercising this sage advice with those we envy often requires all the strength that we can muster."

**Explanation:** This note discusses the practical steps involved in counteracting envy, specifically through restraint and the deliberate choice to be kind. Restraint involves consciously deciding not to communicate negative sentiments born out of envy, while kindness acts as its remedy through positive actions toward others. Envy is calmed by the realization that negativity is self-destructive. Acts of charity transform our internal disposition, breaking the cycle of envy and fostering growth in virtues like love and humility.

Questions. In Dante’s Purgatorio, the envious have their eyelids sewed together in the manner that wild falcons have their eyelids sewed together for the purpose of taming their fear. This image is symbolic of three aspects of envy. First, the envious are afraid of admitting that someone else is superior to them. Thus, they are squint eyed and look upon the gifts of others with grudging hatred. Jesus says, “The eye is the body’s lamp. If your eyes are good your body will be filled with light. If your eyes are bad (Gk. poneros) your body will be in darkness” (Mt 6:22–23). Poneros means grudging or stingy. Envy is tightfisted and niggardly in giving due praise and compliments to others. Who are the people in your life from whom you withhold compliments because of envy? Second, Dante’s image speaks of envy’s blindness. The envious person is blinded to the goodness of others and is deprived of the joy that flows from rejoicing in what others have. Céline once said to Thérèse, “What I envy about you are your good works.” Thérèse responded by quoting Tauler. ‘If I love the good that is in my neighbour as much as he loves it himself, that good is as much mine as it is his.’ Through this communion I can enrich myself with all the good that there is in heaven and on earth, in the angels, in the saints and in all those who love God.”10 The behaviors that flow from envy—backbiting, detraction, etc., destroy our ability to see goodness in our neighbor. Reflect upon the misery that such behaviors bring into your life. Think of how you could be enriched if you were able to find joy in your neighbor. If our neighbor isn’t a gift then he is a threat. Which is he for you? Third, Dante’s image points to one of the basic means which we must employ in the taming of envy—restraint. Just as newly caught falcons have their eyelids sewed together in order to calm their fears and make them obedient to their masters, so too must the fear of the envious be quieted so that they will not fly off in a rage and attack their neighbor. This can be done by our choosing not to act upon envious feelings, for example, not to engage in detraction and backbiting. As our mothers told us when we were children, “If you can’t say anything good about another person then don’t say anything at all.” Exercising this sage advice with those we envy often requires all the strength that we can muster. But in doing so, we grow in charity, the remedy of envy. Who are the people in your life whom you find most difficult not to malign? Finally, Dante offers us another exercise in dealing with envy. As the envious are huddled in a group with their eyelids sewed together, they hear a passing voice echoing the Virgin Mary’s words at the wedding feast of Cana “Vinum non habent” (“They have no wine”). Mary’s act of thoughtfulness is an example of the antidote that we must employ to quell envious behavior. Looking out for the good of one’s neighbor is healing balm for envious eyes. What acts of kindness and thoughtfulness can you choose to do for people whom you envy?
