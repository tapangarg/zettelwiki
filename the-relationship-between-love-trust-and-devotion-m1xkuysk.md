**Note 3: The Essence of Devotion**  
**Title:** The Relationship Between Love, Trust, and Devotion  
**Quote:** "Because the love is already here, so love mixed with faith, mixed with trust, is devotion."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Love is inherent within us, and when combined with faith and trust, it manifests as devotion.

**Explanation:** The speaker refers to the idea that love exists within everyone inherently. When this love is conjoined with trust and faith, it naturally evolves into devotion. This process suggests that devotion is not merely about fervent belief or action but rather a deep-seated expression that emerges when one recognizes the interplay of these elements. Understanding the nuances of love, trust, and faith allows individuals to cultivate a more profound, genuine form of devotion, enriching their spiritual lives and practices.

**Connections:**

- **Faith and Works:** The discussed principle can connect with theological discussions around the nature of faith and its expression through action.
