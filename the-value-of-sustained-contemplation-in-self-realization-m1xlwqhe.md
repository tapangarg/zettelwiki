**Note 3: The Worth of Contemplation**  
**Title:** The Value of Sustained Contemplation in Self-Realization  
**Quote:** "Even if this entire lifetime goes with this contemplation, it will be worthwhile."  
**Translation into Modern English:** If my entire life is spent in this inquiry, it will ultimately be a valuable and meaningful pursuit.  
**Explanation:** This notion reinforces the profound importance of deep contemplation in the search for understanding and truth. It highlights that the journey itself, regardless of external accomplishments or timelines, carries intrinsic value. The commitment to understanding oneself through sustained inquiry serves not only as a means of personal growth but also as a path that leads to profound insights about existence. Recognizing that the pursuit of self-understanding may take a lifetime suggests a shift in perspective towards embracing an ongoing process rather than seeking immediate results. In a world often motivated by rapid outcomes, this perspective calls for patience, determination, and a deeper appreciation for the journey of self-discovery.  
**Connections:**  
- **Spiritual Growth through Practice:** The idea aligns with various spiritual traditions that value the process of learning, practicing, and growing over quick fixes.  
- **Philosophical Existentialism:** Emphasizes the importance of the individual journey and the personal meaning one derives from existence.  
- **Meditation and Awareness Practices:** These practices cultivate deep inner reflection and self-exploration, resonating with prolonged contemplation.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"Way of the Heart" by Henri Nouwen:** This book reflects on how the inner journey is as valuable as its destination.  
- **"The Art of Living: The Classical Manual on Virtue, Happiness, and Effectiveness" by Epictetus:** Illustrates how leading a life of principles takes consistent investigation and reflection.  
- **"A New Earth" by Eckhart Tolle:** Discusses how elevating our consciousness through understanding our ego is an ongoing and worthwhile process.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What does it mean to commit my life to the process of self-discovery without the expectation of conclusions or outcomes?
