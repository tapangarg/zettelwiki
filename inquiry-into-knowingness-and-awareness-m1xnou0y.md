**Note 2: The Role of Awareness in Existence**  
**Title:** Inquiry into Knowingness and Awareness  
**Quote:** "There is an ‘I’ which is even more fundamental, even more prior to the existence of this ‘Am’. ... It is Knowingness Itself, it is Awareness Itself."  
**Translation into Modern English:** There is an aspect of 'I' that precedes the ‘Am’—this refers to our inherent awareness and understanding that is not defined by concepts or thought.  

**Explanation:** This statement highlights the significance of pure awareness as even more foundational than the existence we typically recognize as 'I Am.' The author invites us to inquire deeply into this knowing and awareness that resides within us, which is often overlooked in our everyday thoughts and identity. This knowingness represents our fundamental consciousness, which underlies all experience. By focusing on awareness rather than thought, we can discover a more expansive understanding of our existence, free from the limitations of conceptual thinking. Engaging with this direct knowledge can lead to profound transformation and insight into our true nature.  

**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness:** The practice of being aware in the present moment helps individuals tap into this underlying awareness that is discussed here.  
- **Transcendental Awareness in Meditation:** Many meditative practices suggest looking beyond the thoughts to experience pure awareness.  
- **Philosophy of Consciousness:** Discussions in both Western and Eastern philosophy regarding the nature of consciousness often touch on awareness as fundamental to existence.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **The Mind Illuminated:** By Culadasa (John Yates), which offers insight into mindfulness and the nature of awareness in meditation.  
- **Being Aware of Being Aware:** By John J. Prendergast, exploring awareness and its implications on identity and experience.  
- **What is Consciousness?:** By Susan Blackmore, which evaluates different theories surrounding consciousness and awareness.  

**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can you explore the distinction between thought-based identity and fundamental awareness to deepen your understanding of self?
