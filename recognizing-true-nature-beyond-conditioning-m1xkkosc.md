**Note 2: The Purpose of Spiritual Inquiry**  
**Title:** Recognizing True Nature Beyond Conditioning  
**Quote:** "We are here to recognize who we are and to drop all conditioning."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Our journey is to discover our true selves, free from all learned behaviors and societal expectations.  
**Explanation:** This quote speaks to the transformative journey of self-discovery that aligns with many spiritual teachings. Instead of acquiring a new set of beliefs or frameworks, the purpose is to peel back layers of conditioning that obscure our true nature. This recognition fosters an authentic self-identity that is not limited by external influences or past experiences. It’s significant because it empowers individuals to see through the illusions imposed by society, leading to a greater sense of freedom and authenticity.
