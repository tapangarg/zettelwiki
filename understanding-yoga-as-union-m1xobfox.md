**Note 5: The Concept of Yoga**  
**Title:** Understanding Yoga as Union  
**Quote:** "Yoga: Literally, 'to yoke, harness, unite'; union in which the subject and object of meditation have become one."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Yoga means to unite or bring together; it describes a state wherein the meditator and the object of meditation merge into a single experience.  
**Explanation:** Yoga, in its most essential form, denotes a union or integration of the individual self with a higher reality or consciousness. This definition emphasizes the transformative potential of yoga practices, as they guide practitioners to move beyond the dualistic perceptions of subject and object, leading to a holistic experience of existence. This union brings a profound sense of peace and understanding, dissolving the barriers created by the ego. This idea holds great significance, as it not only encourages physical and mental well-being but also promotes spiritual growth and self-realization. In essence, the practice of yoga fosters a deeper connection with oneself and the universe, facilitating experiences of unity that enrich individual and collective existence.
