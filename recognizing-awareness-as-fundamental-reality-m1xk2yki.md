**Note 2: The Nature of Awareness**  
**Title:** Recognizing Awareness as Fundamental Reality  
**Quote:** "What is that which knows the phenomenal appearance? I know the phenomenal appearance. Who knows that I know? I."  
**Translation into Modern English:** What is it that perceives what we see and experience? I am aware of these experiences, but what is the true source of that awareness? It is merely 'I'.  
**Explanation:** The inquiry presented here revolves around understanding the nature of awareness itself. The author prompts readers to reflect not just on their experiences but on the observerâ€”the one who is aware of these experiences. This inquiry encourages individuals to distinguish between what they perceive (the phenomenal world) and the consciousness that perceives it. By recognizing that our true essence is not the experiences themselves but the awareness that knows them, we are guided towards a more profound realization of our own existence. This distinction is crucial for spiritual growth, as it allows individuals to detach from judgments and narratives tied to their experiences, facilitating a deeper connection with their true nature.  
**Connections:**

- **The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success:** By Deepak Chopra, which touches on awareness and intention as fundamental aspects of achieving fulfillment.  
- **Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality:** By Anthony DeMello, which discusses the transformative power of understanding awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does understanding the distinction between the observer and the observed impact my approach to my everyday experiences and personal growth?
