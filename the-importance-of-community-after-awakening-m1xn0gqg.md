**Note 2: The Role of Satsang in Spiritual Growth**

**Title:** The Importance of Community After Awakening 

**Quote:** “That is why it is said that it is even more important after an awakening experience or the recognition of the Truth to keep coming to satsang.”

**Translation into Modern English:** It’s crucial to continue participating in gatherings that focus on spiritual truth after one has experienced awakening.

**Explanation:** This statement highlights the significance of community and ongoing support in the spiritual journey. Satsang, or congregational gatherings centered on truth-seeking discussions, is presented as a fertile ground for spiritual growth. After an awakening experience, individuals may find themselves navigating subtle tendencies and distractions from their ego, which can easily resurface. Engaging with supportive spiritual communities helps to reinforce understanding, offers guidance, and can counteract feelings of isolation that often accompany deeper realizations. The collective energy in these gatherings creates a conducive environment for exploring deeper truths and challenges, making them essential for continued transformation.
