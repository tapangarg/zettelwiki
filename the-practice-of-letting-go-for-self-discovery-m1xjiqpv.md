**Note 3: Letting Go of Thoughts**  
**Title:** The Practice of Letting Go for Self-Discovery  
**Quote:** "Okay, don't let go of all of your thoughts, just let go of the next one."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Instead of releasing all your thoughts at once, focus only on the next thought that arises.  
**Explanation:** This approach to letting go simplifies the often overwhelming process of managing one's thoughts. It suggests that rather than striving for an unattainable state of thoughtlessness, individuals can begin by releasing their attachment to the immediate thought that arises. This method acknowledges the reality of constant mental chatter but emphasizes that freedom can emerge incrementally. By focusing on the next thought, practitioners can gradually cultivate a mindset that is lighter and less burdened by incessant thinking. This process promotes increased awareness and presence while reducing anxiety, making it a practical technique for personal growth.  
**Connections:**

- **Mindful Meditation:** A practice closely aligned with letting go, where awareness is directed towards breathing or sensations rather than thoughts.  
- **Spiritual Bypassing:** Understanding how unacknowledged thoughts can cause stagnation in growth if not addressed appropriately.
