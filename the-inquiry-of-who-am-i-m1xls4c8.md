**Note 2: The Inquiry into the 'I'**  
**Title:** The Inquiry of ‘Who am I?’  
**Quote:** "Don’t leave this question. It is really the root of ‘Who am I?’"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Keep this question close at hand; it is fundamentally connected to the inquiry into my own identity.  
**Explanation:** This vital question challenges one to continuously examine the nature of their identity, particularly in relation to their Awareness. It urges the seeker to persistently address the question of 'Who am I?' beyond superficial definitions associated with personal characteristics or societal roles. This quest fosters significant introspection, enabling one to peel back layers of perceived identity until reaching a fundamental understanding of existence. It highlights that the pursuit of self-awareness is an ongoing journey, pivotal for personal and spiritual growth as it promotes a clearer comprehension of our true nature. The depth of this inquiry has echoed throughout spiritual teachings, emphasizing its importance across various traditions and practices.
