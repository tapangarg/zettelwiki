**Note 2: The Presence of Being**  
**Title:** The Ever-Present Nature of Being  
**Quote:** "Can anyone say that I had an experience which was outside of my Being? Can anyone say that the Being was absent?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Can anyone truly claim to have an experience that was outside their consciousness? Is there ever a moment when Being is not present?  

**Explanation:** The author emphasizes the omnipresence of Being in consciousness and experience. This assertion invites reflection on the fundamental nature of existence and conscious awareness. If every experience, whether in waking or dreaming states, occurs within this shared space of Being, it underscores the idea that our essence is always available and active, regardless of external circumstances. Recognizing this constant presence can foster a deeper understanding of oneself and one's spiritual journey, encouraging a state of awareness that transcends everyday distractions and challenges.  

**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques that encourage present-moment awareness align with the idea that Being is always present.  
- **Existential Philosophy:** Thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre explore the relationship between consciousness, existence, and being, echoing similar themes of presence.  
- **Transpersonal Psychology:** This field examines experiences that transcend the individual self, linking to discussions of universal consciousness.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which delves into presence and consciousness in daily life.  
- **The Mind Illuminated:** By Culadasa, which combines neuroscience and meditation techniques aimed at fostering awareness of being.  
- **Presence: An Exploration of Profound Change in People, Organizations, and Society:** By Peter Senge, which examines the concept of being present in a broader context.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How can recognizing the omnipresence of Being shift the way you engage with your experiences and challenges?
