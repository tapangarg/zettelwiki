**Note 3: The Role of Perception in Reality**  
**Title:** Seeing Beyond the Surface  
**Quote:** "Rely on your Seeing now. See how your attention is just moving within you."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Trust in your ability to observe. Notice how your focus operates internally, influencing your understanding of the world.  
**Explanation:** This advice to "rely on your Seeing" points to the crucial role that perception plays in shaping our experiences. The encouragement to observe how our attention travels inward underscores that our internal narratives, thoughts, and feelings color our perception of external reality. The significance of this concept lies in the understanding that our outer world is a reflection of our inner state, thus highlighting the importance of inner work for constructing meaningful external realities. This idea encourages practitioners to explore not only the nature of their thoughts but also how these thoughts manifest externally, shaping their interactions and experiences.
