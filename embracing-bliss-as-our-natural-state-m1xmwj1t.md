**Note 3: Natural Happiness as a State of Being**  
**Title:** Embracing Bliss as Our Natural State  
**Quote:** "I felt that I am naturally feeling this pleasant-ness as a natural state of my Being so I don’t need to do anything else."  
**Translation into Modern English:** I realized that this feeling of pleasantness is a fundamental aspect of who I am; there is nothing more I need to pursue to access it.  

**Explanation:** The speaker articulates a powerful insight—the recognition that bliss and pleasantness are inherent aspects of their being. This presents a perspective shift from seeking happiness externally to recognizing it as a natural state worth experiencing. It underscores a significant spiritual principle, emphasizing that fulfillment comes from within rather than being contingent on external circumstances or activities. This realization fosters a sense of peace and contentment, which can profoundly impact one’s approach to life and spiritual practice.
