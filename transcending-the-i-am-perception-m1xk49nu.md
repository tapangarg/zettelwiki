**Note 2: The Sense of ‘I Am’**  
**Title:** Transcending the ‘I Am’ Perception  
**Quote:** "So, it is true that [Nisargadatta] Maharaj prescribed the practice of ‘Stay with the Presence’. And with this ‘Staying with the Presence’ then ultimately you realize that even the sense ‘I Am’ is not what you are."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Nisargadatta Maharaj emphasized the importance of remaining present. Through this practice, one comes to the realization that even the identification of oneself as 'I Am' does not encapsulate the true nature of one's being.  
**Explanation:** The phrase ‘I Am’ represents a fundamental aspect of human identity—our primary sense of being. However, this note emphasizes that clinging to this identity limits our understanding of our true nature, which lies beyond ‘I Am.’ By ‘Staying with the Presence,’ practitioners are encouraged to observe the phenomenon of existence without labeling or defining it, ultimately leading to the dissolution of the egoic self. This realization is crucial in spiritual practices, facilitating a deeper connection to the universal aspect of consciousness.  
**Connections:**  
- **Ego and Identity in Psychology:** The exploration of self-concept in psychology can parallel this philosophical inquiry into the sense of self.  
- **Mystical Experiences Across Traditions:** Many mystical paths, including Sufism and Kabbalism, speak of transcending the egoic self to connect with a larger universal presence.  
- **Philosophical Works on Self:** Exploring texts from existentialists who grapple with identity can deepen the understanding of the significance of transcending ‘I Am.’  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle:** Emphasizes the transcendence of the ego and the importance of living in the present.  
- **"Being Nobody, Going Nowhere" by Thich Nhat Hanh:** Offers insights into the nature of self and the journey toward realizing our interconnection with all beings.  
- **"The Upanishads": As foundational texts examine the concepts of self-awareness and realization in the context of eternal consciousness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What are the implications of viewing the ‘I Am’ as a transient label versus the essence of who you truly are?
