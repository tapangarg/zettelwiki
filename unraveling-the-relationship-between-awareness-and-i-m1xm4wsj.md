**Note 2: The Inquiry of 'Who is Aware?'**  
**Title:** Unraveling the Relationship Between 'Awareness' and 'I'  
**Quote:** "'Who is aware of Awareness?' is a very important inquiry, because it removes the dichotomy between ‘Awareness’ and ‘I’ which the mind tries to create."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The question of who is cognizant of awareness is crucial as it dissolves the false separation between the concept of awareness and the sense of self that the mind constructs.  
**Explanation:** This inquiry serves as a pivotal tool for recognizing non-dual awareness, where the observer ('I') and the observed (awareness) are ultimately the same. It challenges the belief that we can be separate or distinct from our own understanding of awareness. By contemplating this question, we remove the barriers that the self-imposed mind creates, leading us to a greater state of unity and clarity regarding our spiritual essence. This philosophical approach emphasizes the importance of direct experience over intellectual understanding in the journey of self-inquiry, a central theme in many contemplative traditions.  
**Connections:**  
- **Self-Inquiry (Atma Vichara):** Practiced in the teachings of Ramana Maharshi, this method emphasizes the core question of "Who am I?" leading to insight into the true nature of self and existence.  
- **Awareness in Advaita Vedanta:** A non-dualistic philosophy that teaches the oneness of reality, underscoring the integral relationship between awareness and the self.  
- **Buddhist Concept of Anatta (Non-Self):** Challenges the idea of a permanent, separate self, illuminating the fluid nature of identity and awareness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Who Am I?: The Teachings of Ramana Maharshi:** A classic text on self-inquiry and the nature of true self-awareness.  
- **The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching:** By Thich Nhat Hanh, which offers insights into understanding self and awareness through Buddhist perspectives.  
- **The Upanishads:** Ancient Indian texts exploring the nature of self and ultimate reality, emphasizing the non-duality of awareness and existence.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways do our beliefs about self and awareness limit our experience of true being and existence?
