**Note 3: The Challenge of Identity in Meditation**  
**Title:** The Struggle with Bodily Identification in Meditation  
**Quote:** "I realize that when I say 'I exist' I identify too much with my bodily sensations."  
**Translation into Modern English:** I've come to understand that my declaration of existence often ties me excessively to my physical sensations and identity.  
**Explanation:** This remark sheds light on the tension that can arise during meditation when one's sense of self becomes too intertwined with bodily experiences. Such identification draws practitioners away from the deeper aspects of their existence, anchoring them to transient sensations rather than their unchanging essence. This can be a significant barrier to achieving a more profound state of awareness in meditation, where the objective is to connect with the pure, unconditioned sense of being. Recognizing and navigating this challenge is a key aspect of spiritual growth, as it involves disentangling identity from physicality and engaging with a more profound awareness.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Practice of Body Scan in Mindfulness:** This technique helps individuals observe bodily sensations without becoming attached to them, promoting disidentification from physical sensations.  
- **Yoga Philosophy:** The teachings often emphasize the understanding of the ‘self’ beyond the physical body, advocating for a holistic view of existence.  
- **Transcendence in Mystical Traditions:** Many traditions emphasize the act of transcending the physical self as a means of spiritual liberation.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma** by Bessel van der Kolk, which discusses the connection between body awareness and psychological well-being.  
- **Riding the Eye of the Storm** by A. B. Kahn, which explores the meditation practice and the challenges that come with losing the sense of self.  
- **Yoga Sutras of Patanjali**, which discusses the nature of self and mind in relation to the physical body.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can you learn to experience your bodily sensations without letting them define your sense of self?
