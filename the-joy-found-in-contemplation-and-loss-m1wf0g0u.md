**Note 4: Thérèse's Reflection on Maternal Loss**  
**Title:** The Joy Found in Contemplation and Loss  
**Quote:** “I had no need to raise my head to see and, in fact, no longer raised it but to contemplate heaven which to me was filled with joy.”  
**Translation into Modern English:** I didn’t need to look up; I simply focused on contemplating heaven, which filled me with joy.  
**Explanation:** This reflection from Thérèse shows how contemplation can become a source of profound joy, even amidst the pain of loss. By redirecting her focus toward the divine, she finds solace and an uplifting connection that transcends her grief. It emphasizes that turning our thoughts to higher realms can provide strength in difficult times.
