**Note 2: The Nature of Divine Presence and the Absolute**  
**Title:** Choosing Between the Divine and the Absolute  
**Quote:** "Should I stay with God? (as Being) or â€˜Should I stay with the Absolute from which even God comes?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Should I focus on my relationship with God as a being, or delve deeper into the underlying reality that gives rise to even the concept of God?  
**Explanation:** This note presents the dual paths one can choose in spiritual exploration: the personal relationship with God as a Being and the pursuit of understanding the Absolute that transcends all forms, including the Divine. Both paths have their beauty, yet the speaker suggests that choosing to connect with the Absolute may offer a more profound liberation since it goes beyond the limitations associated with godly personhood. This choice brings into focus the intricacies of spiritual practice and the varying degrees of closeness one may feel towards the sacred, raising questions about the nature of divinity and the varied approaches to grasping ultimate reality.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Concept of God in Different Religions:** Different traditions have varying interpretations of God, which may stem from either personal (theistic) or impersonal (non-theistic) understandings of the Divine.  
- **Philosophical Discussions on Being vs. Becoming:** Philosophers often explore the tension between eternal constants (Being) and the flowing nature of existence (becoming), paralleling the choice between God and the Absolute.  
- **The Path of Advaita Vedanta:** This Hindu philosophy emphasizes the non-duality of Atman (self) and Brahman (universal spirit), suggesting an exploration of the self that transcends limited representations of divinity.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"The Seven Storey Mountain" by Thomas Merton**, an exploration of the author's spiritual journey towards deeper understanding of God and existence.  
- **"The Ascent of Mount Carmel" by St. John of the Cross**, which discusses the journey towards union with the Divine beyond mere personhood.  
- **"The Essential Rumi" translated by Coleman Barks**, which captures the personal and absolute dimensions of the divine in Sufi poetry.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can the balance between understanding God as a personal being and the pursuit of the Absolute enrich our spiritual practices and personal growth?
