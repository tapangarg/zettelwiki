**Note 3: The State of Presence**

**Title:** Embracing the Natural State of Being

**Quote:** "When you’re just not relating to anything; just here in this Presence, as This Presence; when you’re just empty."

**Translation into Modern English:** True presence is achieved when one is not engaged with external distractions or relationships but simply exists in a state of being—void of attachments or emotional clutter.

**Explanation:** This phrase captures the essence of experiencing presence in its purest form. The speaker clarifies that real presence involves a state of emptiness where the individual is free from distractions, preoccupations, or the need to relate to situations or feelings analytically. This 'empty' state is not a lack but a completeness that allows for profound connection with the self and the universe. This concept can lead to heightened awareness and a deeper appreciation of life.

**Connections:**
- **Zen Buddhism:** Zen practices emphasize being present and the art of 'just sitting,' which encourages experiencing reality without verbal and mental chatter.
- **Transcendental Meditation:** This practice fosters a state of inner silence and presence by transcending active thought.
- **Flow and Creativity:** Many creative processes describe a similar state of being fully immersed in the moment, leading to both joy and productivity.

**Further Reading:**
- **The Miracle of Mindfulness:** By Thich Nhat Hanh, which emphasizes the practice of being present in every moment.
- **Wherever You Go, There You Are:** By Jon Kabat-Zinn, which offers insights on mindfulness meditation and presence.
- **Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking:** By Susan Cain, which touches upon the value of introspection and empty spaces in fostering creativity and understanding.

**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can I cultivate a deeper sense of presence in my daily life, and how might this awareness influence my relationships and my perception of experiences?
