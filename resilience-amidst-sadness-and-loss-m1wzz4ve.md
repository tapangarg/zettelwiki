**Title:** Resilience Amidst Sadness and Loss

**Quote:** "What gave you the strength to bear the sadness of loss at these times?"

**Explanation:** The inquiry invites self-reflection on the sources of strength that individuals draw upon during periods of intense sadness and loss. It encourages an exploration of personal resilience and the mechanisms—be they spiritual, emotional, or relational—that help sustain one through sorrowful experiences.
