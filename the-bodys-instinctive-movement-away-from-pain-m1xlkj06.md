**Note 2: The Natural Instinct to Avoid Pain**  
**Title:** The Body's Instinctive Movement Away from Pain  
**Quote:** "But the body which is moving away from pain is which one? [Silence] It’s naturally designed in this realm, as Consciousness has designed it, that the movement away from pain happens."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Our bodies are inherently programmed to move away from pain, a natural design of Consciousness in this existence.  
**Explanation:** This notion highlights how our biological and psychological makeup drives us to protect ourselves from pain and discomfort, underscoring an instinctual aspect of existence. This mechanism is not merely about avoiding physical pain but also encompasses emotional and psychological discomfort. The consideration of this natural instinct opens a wider understanding of how we navigate our experiences and make choices. However, the awareness of this instinct should not lead us to become overly reactive, as attachment to the avoidance of pain can also trap us in cycles of fear and resistance. Recognizing this instinct allows individuals to develop a mindful approach to their pain and suffering, fostering growth rather than avoidance.
