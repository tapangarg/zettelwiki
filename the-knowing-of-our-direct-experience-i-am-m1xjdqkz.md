**Note 8: Direct Experience of Being**  
**Title:** The Knowing of Our Direct Experience: ‘I Am’  
**Quote:** "The knowing of our direct experience that ‘I Am’."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Recognizing our own existence in the simplest terms as ‘I am’ is a profound direct experience.  
**Explanation:** This points to the essence of being. The acknowledgment of ‘I am’ reflects an unmediated experience of existence that is both grounding and liberating. Understanding this as the core of our being can significantly impact our relationship with self and reality. It invites practices that deepen this experience and encourage living from this awareness, rather than from conditioned identities.  
**Connections:**  
- **Existential Affirmation:** Philosophical explorations of existence affirming being as fundamental to human experience.  
- **Ego Dissolution Practices:** Ways in which the direct experience of ‘I Am’ can reduce egoic influences on our perception.  
- **Consciousness Studies:** The field that investigates the nature of consciousness and self-awareness, particularly the experiences of being.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Consciousness Explained:** By Daniel C. Dennett, which provides a thorough exploration of consciousness and self-identity.  
- **The Nature of Consciousness:** By Rupert Spira, offering insights into awareness and being from a non-dual perspective.  
- **Awakening to the Dream:** By Leo Hartong, which touches on the realization of being as an awakening process.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does deeply understanding and integrating the simple acknowledgment of ‘I am’ influence our daily lives and interactions?
