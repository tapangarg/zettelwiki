**Note 2: Thoughts and Happiness**  
**Title:** The Role of Attention in Achieving Happiness  
**Quote:** "If I want to be happy, then all I have to do is not to give attention to my thoughts."  
**Translation into Modern English:** To attain happiness, the essential step is to learn not to focus on my thoughts and narratives.  
**Explanation:** This statement reveals a significant insight into the nature of happiness as it relates to mental activity. The notion suggests that our ability to attain happiness is heavily influenced by where we direct our attention. When we choose to focus on our thoughts, especially those that are negative or self-critical, we inadvertently create barriers to our well-being. However, by intentionally choosing to divert our attention away from these thoughts, we can cultivate a state of happiness that is less susceptible to mental fluctuations. This aligns with various psychological frameworks that emphasize that happiness is often about perspective and focus rather than external conditions or outcomes.  
**Connections:**

- **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** A therapeutic approach that teaches how to accept thoughts without allowing them to dictate actions.  
- **The 4 Noble Truths in Buddhism:** Highlighting that attachment to desires and thoughts is a root cause of suffering, thus reframing happiness as a practice of attention.
