**Note 2: The Inquiry into Satisfaction**  
**Title:** Exploring the Nature of Completion and Joy  
**Quote:** "What should feel satisfied? What should feel complete? Joy should come?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** The speaker poses questions concerning what it means to feel satisfied or complete, suggesting that joy might be the expected outcome of such feelings.  
**Explanation:** This inquiry invites deep reflection on the nature of satisfaction and emotional fulfillment. The suggestions that joy should arise from a sense of completion highlight that many individuals often seek external validation or intellectual conclusions as markers of contentment. However, the speaker challenges this notion, prompting an examination of whether such feelings are fleeting or if they stem from a deeper understanding of one's true self and presence in the moment. This framing can lead to significant breakthroughs in personal development, as practitioners may realize that true joy is found not in conclusions or concepts, but rather in the ongoing experience of life itself.  
**Connections:**  
- **Happiness in the Present Moment:** Buddhist teachings emphasize joy arising from being fully present rather than from achieving external goals.  
- **Philosophy of Existentialism:** Existential philosophy often wrestles with concepts of fulfillment and the search for meaning beyond societal constructs.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** The practice of mindfulness encourages individuals to experience joy in the simplicity of the present moment rather than chasing thoughts of completion.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Happiness Project** by Gretchen Rubin, which explores practices to cultivate joy and satisfaction in everyday life.  
- **Radical Acceptance** by Tara Brach, which examines the themes of acceptance and embracing oneâ€™s present experience as a pathway to joy.  
- **The Art of Happiness** by the Dalai Lama, which discusses the nature of happiness and finding joy in the moment.  
**Question for Contemplation:** Is true satisfaction found within ourselves, or is it conditioned by external circumstances and achievements?
