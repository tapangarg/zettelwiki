**Note 1: Challenging Personal Limitations**  
**Title:** Evolving Perspectives on Self-Limitations  
**Quote:** "I felt that ‘This is not allowed, this can’t be me’ and then I felt that ‘This is allowed’. And then gradually this ‘What I can’t be’ kept getting challenged gradually."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Initially, I experienced thoughts that certain aspects of my being were off-limits or unacceptable. However, over time, I started to believe that exploring those limits was permissible. This realization led to a slow but steady challenge of my previous limitations.  

**Explanation:** This note reflects the internal journey of self-discovery and the ongoing struggle against restrictive self-concepts. The speaker begins by internalizing societal or self-imposed boundaries, which creates a dichotomy between who they feel they should be and who they can become. The realization that these boundaries can be challenged signifies a crucial turning point towards personal growth. The phrase "this is allowed" represents a shift in consciousness that permits exploration beyond previously constructed limits. The process of confronting and redefining what we believe to be impossible is central to personal evolution, shaping our understanding of identity and capability. 

**Connections:**  
- **Growth Mindset:** The principle that abilities and intelligence can be developed through hard work and dedication, demonstrating how challenges help reshape our self-concept.  
- **Cognitive Dissonance:** The psychological discomfort that arises when confronted with conflicting beliefs, which may catalyze re-evaluation of personal limitations.  
- **Self-Actualization Theory (Maslow):** The idea that individuals must overcome obstacles within themselves to reach their full potential, emphasizing ongoing growth and realization of capabilities.

**Further Reading:**  
- **Mindset: The New Psychology of Success** by Carol S. Dweck, which discusses the importance of adopting a growth mindset for personal development.  
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment** by Eckhart Tolle, which explores consciousness and presence in redefining self-perceptions.  
- **Transcending the Ego: Awakening to Your True Nature** by Joan Borysenko, which offers insights into dismantling limiting beliefs to connect with a deeper sense of self.

**Question for Contemplation:** How can confronting and redefining your perceived limitations lead to a more authentic expression of self, and what steps can you take to begin this process?
