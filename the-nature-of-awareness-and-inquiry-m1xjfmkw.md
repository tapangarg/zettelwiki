**Note 2: The Inquiry of Awareness**  
**Title:** The Nature of Awareness and Inquiry  
**Quote:** "Are you Aware now? What Knows this?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Are you presently aware? What is the source of this awareness?  
**Explanation:** This series of questions highlights the self-reflective nature of consciousness. It urges individuals to question the very essence of their awarenessâ€”the act of being aware itself. The inquiry of "What Knows this?" points to a deeper layer of consciousness that remains when all constructs and identities are stripped away. This contemplative practice is significant for self-discovery, as it leads to fundamental insights about existence, prompting individuals to separate the observer from the observed and delve deeper into understanding their true essence.  
**Connections:**  
- **Socratic Method**: The inquiry mirrors the Socratic approach of questioning to stimulate critical thinking and uncover underlying beliefs.  
- **Zen Buddhism**: This practice parallels Zen teaching methods that focus on direct experience and self-inquiry.  
- **Existential Philosophy**: Explores core questions around being and existence, much like existential thinkers like Sartre and Heidegger.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"Being and Nothingness" by Jean-Paul Sartre** delves into existential awareness and the nature of being.  
- **"The Zen Teaching of Bodhidharma"** offers insights into direct awakening and inquiry.  
- **"The Art of Power" by Thich Nhat Hanh** discusses mindfulness and the depth of awareness in daily life.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways does the act of questioning your own awareness help reveal deeper truths about your reality and existence?
