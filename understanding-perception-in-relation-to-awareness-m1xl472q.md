**Note 2: The Inquiry of Perception**  
**Title:** Understanding Perception in Relation to Awareness  
**Quote:** "You cannot see it phenomenally."  
**Translation into Modern English:** You are unable to visually perceive awareness in any direct or physical form.  
**Explanation:** This statement highlights the distinction between the conceptual acknowledgment of awareness and the limitations of sensory perception. While we can affirm the existence of awareness, it does not fall within the realm of what can be seen or observed through our senses. This understanding is crucial for deepening our exploration of consciousness; it encourages a shift from a reliance on external validation to an internal recognition of our experiential reality. The importance of this distinction cannot be understated, as it informs practices of introspection and meditation that seek to explore consciousness beyond traditional perceptual frameworks.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Illusion of Duality:** Reflections from both Eastern and Western philosophical perspectives on the separation of observer and observed.  
- **Meditation Practices:** Methods that guide practitioners to become aware of awareness itself rather than focusing solely on objects of consciousness.  
- **Cognitive Science:** Discussions on how the brain interprets stimuli and the limitations of empirical observation in understanding consciousness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Mind Illuminated:** By Culadasa (John Yates), which offers insights into meditation and understanding perception.  
- **Being Conscious:** By N. J. R. A., which discusses the complexities of consciousness and its relation to perception.  
- **What Is Consciousness?:** By John Searle, which presents a philosophical inquiry into the understanding of consciousness and perception.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways might our understanding of awareness and perception shape our interpretations of reality and identity?
