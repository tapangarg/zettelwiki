**Note 2: Abiding in the Self**

**Title:** Recognizing Our Established Nature

**Quote:** "You’re established. You’re abiding in the Self. In fact, you never leave this position."

**Translation into Modern English:** You are in a state of true existence, remaining within your true essence; in reality, you never stray from this state.

**Explanation:** This assertion underscores the idea that our true self is always in a state of being, unaltered and untouched by external circumstances or thoughts. Abiding in the Self means being connected to our essence, which is often obscured by the noise of mental activity. This moment of recognition can serve as a profound insight into our lives; while we may feel disconnected due to our belief in thoughts, our fundamental nature remains intact. The significance lies in the realization that this truth exists independent of our fluctuating states of consciousness. Accepting this can lead to profound inner peace and clarity.
