**Note 1: The Nature of Knowingness**  
**Title:** Understanding the Essence of Knowingness  
**Quote:** "So that which has no distance and has no separation from I, must be I."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The essence of Knowingness is intrinsically linked to the self. There is no separation; what exists within us as Knowingness identifies as our true self.  

**Explanation:** The speaker emphasizes a crucial point regarding the nature of awareness and self-identification. When we experience an event, such as waking up, there exists an awareness of that experience. This awareness, or Knowingness, is intimate with the self and cannot be considered separate from it. This perspective challenges our habitual identification with thoughts and the mind; instead, it invites us to turn our attention to the present moment and the first-person experience of being. Understanding that this Knowingness is our true identification enables a deeper exploration of the self beyond the confines of bodily or mental identifications. The significance lies in how this realization can lead to profound spiritual growth and self-understanding.

**Connections:**  
- **Advaita Vedanta:** This philosophy teaches non-duality, emphasizing the unity of the self and the universe, where the ultimate reality is Knowingness itself.  
- **Mindfulness:** The practice of returning to present experience aligns with recognizing the layers of self-identity and moving beyond them.  
- **The Nature of Consciousness:** Exploring theories around consciousness can deepen one's understanding of the connection between awareness and identity.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That:** A collection of talks by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, introducing non-dual awareness and self-realization.  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which offers insights on living in the present moment and the nature of consciousness.  
- **Who Am I?:** A pivotal text by Ramana Maharshi, discussing self-inquiry and the nature of self.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How can recognizing the presence of Knowingness reshape your understanding of self and help you detach from limiting identities associated with thoughts and feelings?
