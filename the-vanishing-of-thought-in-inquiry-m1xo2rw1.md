**Note 4: The Disappearance of the Mind**  
**Title:** The Vanishing of Thought in Inquiry  
**Quote:** "Mind disappeared... If there is a question, the mind disappeared, and now it’s making a come-back."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When engaged in deep inquiry or contemplation, there can be a moment when thoughts fade, followed by a resurgence of mental activity.  
**Explanation:** This observation touches on the cyclical nature of thought during inquiry. It illustrates how intense questioning or contemplation can momentarily dissolve mental processes, allowing insights to emerge. The idea that the mind 'disappears' indicates a shift into a space of profound inquiry, where conventional thinking ceases, and a deeper understanding may arise. This state can yield creative insights, breakthroughs, or clarity that can be clouded by overthinking. As thoughts then return, it represents a balancing act between depth of thought and the insights gained in stillness, prompting us to consider how mental activity can both hinder and facilitate understanding.
