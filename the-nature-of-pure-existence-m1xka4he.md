**Note 1: The Essence of Pure Being**  
**Title:** The Nature of Pure Existence  
**Quote:** "So, first we come to this unassociated Being, where it is just Being. It is not being anything. Not ‘I am something’. Not even ‘I am nothing’. Just ‘I Am’."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Initially, we arrive at a state of pure existence, defined simply as Being, devoid of any labels or attachments—neither claiming to 'be something' nor 'to be nothing'—just the essence of existence as 'I Am'.  
**Explanation:** This concept challenges the typical dualistic thinking that confines us within identities or transient states of being. It posits that true understanding begins in recognizing a primordial state of existence that transcends all definitions. In this state, one does not identify with thoughts or roles but acknowledges a fundamental essence of existence. This understanding has profound implications for spiritual growth, suggesting that liberation from suffering arises not from acquiring something new but from realizing what is already present—the pure state of Being. Identifying with this unassociated Being negates the judgments and attachments that fuel internal conflict, providing tranquility and a sense of freedom from the incessant chatter of the mind.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Dualism:** The notion aligns closely with non-dualistic philosophies found in Advaita Vedanta, which emphasize the unity of existence and the illusory nature of separateness.  
- **Mindfulness and Presence:** This idea resonates with mindfulness practices that encourage being present in the moment, free from judgment or attachment, which nurtures a deeper awareness of life.  
- **Enlightenment and Liberation:** The recognition of pure Being serves as a foundation for many spiritual traditions centered around the dissolution of the ego and the realization of one's true nature beyond the self.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, which explores the concept of self and ultimate reality through dialogues.  
- **The Power of Now** by Eckhart Tolle, which discusses the significance of presence and how to access the state of Being.  
- **The Heart of Meditation** by the Dalai Lama, which provides insights into recognizing pure awareness and presence through meditation practices.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can the realization of pure Being as an unassociated state alter our everyday interactions and emotional responses, liberating us from the constraints of our identities?
