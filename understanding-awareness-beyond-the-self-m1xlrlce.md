**Note 1: The Nature of Awareness in Relation to Being**

**Title:** Understanding Awareness Beyond the Self

**Quote:** “Why do we say I know or I am Aware? Why don’t we say I taste Being? Or why don’t we say I smell Being?”

**Translation into Modern English:** Why do we express our understanding through statements like ‘I know’ or ‘I am aware’? Why don’t we phrase it as ‘I experience Being through taste’ or ‘I perceive Being through smell’?

**Explanation:** The text delves into the complexity of self-awareness and the language we use to articulate our experiences. The question posed suggests that our linguistic framework often limits our understanding of profound truths. When we state “I know” or “I am aware,” we separate ourselves from the act of awareness itself, imposing a sense of personal subjectivity on what is inherently a shared experience of consciousness. This points to a deeper philosophical conversation about the nature of existence and how we perceive the world around us. The feeling of ‘I know’ implies a holder of knowledge, suggesting an individual self, which distances the experience of being away from the essence of awareness. This distinction is significant as it encourages a shift from a personal perspective of experience to a more universal understanding of consciousness, urging us to explore awareness as a direct experience without attributing it to the self.

**Connections:** 
- **Phenomenology:** This branch of philosophy explores consciousness and experience as they are perceived. It parallels the idea of experiencing Being in a raw form. 
- **Advaita Vedanta:** An ancient Indian philosophy focusing on non-duality, emphasizing that the self and the universe are inseparable—fitting into the notion of experiencing Being without the self.
- **Mindfulness:** The practice of being present in the moment without judgment can connect with recognizing and separating emotions and thoughts from awareness itself.

**Further Reading:**
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment** by Eckhart Tolle, which underscores the significance of being present and aware in the current moment.
- **Phenomenology of Spirit** by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, which may provide insights into the development of self-consciousness.
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, which embodies the teachings of non-duality and awareness beyond the self.

**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing the distinction between awareness and the self shape our understanding of our experiences and the nature of reality?
