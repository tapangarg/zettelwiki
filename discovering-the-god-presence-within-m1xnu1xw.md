**Note 1: Inquiry into God-Presence**  
**Title:** Discovering the God-Presence Within  
**Quote:** "This contemplation, this inquiry to the sense of Being is the inquiry into your own God-Presence."  
**Translation into Modern English:** This reflective practice, which involves seeking an understanding of Being, is fundamentally about recognizing and connecting with your inherent divine nature.  
**Explanation:** This statement emphasizes the importance of introspective contemplation as a way to connect with the divine within oneself. It suggests that by turning our attention inward and engaging in self-inquiry, we can uncover the essence of our being that is intertwined with the God-Presence. This acknowledgment initiates a profound exploration into our identity and connection to the universe, reflecting the belief that the divine presence is not external but resides within, inviting us to understand that we are expressions of that divinity. This realization is significant in fostering a sense of unity with all existence, leading to personal growth and a transformative spiritual journey.
