**Note 3: Establishing Presence in Awareness**  
**Title:** The Paradox of Establishing Awareness  
**Quote:** "Actually, ‘established’ is how you start the moment."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The notion of being ‘established’ in awareness actually begins as soon as the present moment starts.  
**Explanation:** This concept challenges conventional notions of what it means to be 'established' or 'abiding' in a state of awareness. Typically, one might think that being established implies a sustained effort or a state that must be maintained. However, the speaker presents a more radical view: the act of recognizing one’s awareness can occur instantaneously, right at this moment. This insight highlights two important aspects of awareness. Firstly, it suggests that awareness is always available and can be tapped into immediately. Secondly, it emphasizes that the journey of spiritual practice does not necessarily involve a long, arduous process; instead, every moment is a fresh opportunity for recognition. This realization can lead to profound transformation; by understanding that presence can start anew each moment, individuals may be more inclined to live with a continuous awareness rather than seeking it as a distant goal.  
**Connections:**  
- **Present Moment Awareness:** Practices that focus on mindfulness advocate for the importance of present-moment engagement, resonating closely with the idea of establishing awareness.  
- **Spiritual Awakening:** The sudden realization of awareness often described in spiritual texts, indicating the potential for insight in an instant.  
- **Flow State Theory:** The psychological state where individuals become fully immersed in activities, paralleling the concept of establishing presence in awareness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"Wherever You Go, There You Are" by Jon Kabat-Zinn:** A comprehensive guide to mindfulness and being present in daily life.  
- **"The Miracle of Mindfulness" by Thich Nhat Hanh:** Discusses how to cultivate mindfulness in every moment effectively.  
- **"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi:** Explores how people can achieve a state of flow and presence in their activities, effectively connecting to awareness and purpose.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can embracing the idea of establishing awareness in each moment transform the way we approach daily activities and interactions with ourselves and others?
