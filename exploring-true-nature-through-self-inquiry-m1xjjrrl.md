**Note 2: Self-Inquiry and Its Methodology**  
**Title:** Exploring True Nature through Self-Inquiry  
**Quote:** "The Inquiry is just a simple questioning about our true nature: 'What am I in reality?'"  
**Translation into Modern English:** The practice of self-inquiry involves a straightforward yet profound question: "What is my true essence?"  
**Explanation:** Self-inquiry is a fundamental practice in many spiritual traditions, which seeks to unveil the true nature of the self. The simplicity of the inquiry belies its depth; questioning "What am I?" invites individuals to look beyond their surface-level identities, roles, and labels. This introspective journey often leads to a realization that one's essence transcends the transient aspects of existence, prompting an awakening to a deeper, unchanging reality. Engaging in this practice encourages a disciplined yet open exploration of identity, ultimately aiming for liberation from ego and illusion.
