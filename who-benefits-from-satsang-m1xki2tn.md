**Note 1: The Nature of Satsang and Its Audience**  
**Title:** Who Benefits from Satsang?  
**Quote:** "Satsang is not for the person because not even in this phenomenal play does a person really come into existence."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Satsang isn't meant for the individual self, as this individual identity is ultimately an illusion within the grand play of existence.  
**Explanation:** The author begins by elucidating the concept of satsang, suggesting that it transcends the individual ego or personality. The real essence of satsang is not about enhancing the personal self, as that self is an ephemeral construct within the phenomenal world. Instead, satsang serves a higher purpose, which is to guide the conscious aspect of Awareness itself towards a deeper realization of oneness with that Awareness. This perspective is crucial for those on a spiritual journey, as it frames the practice of satsang as a means of dissolving the illusion of separateness and conditioning we encounter in our day-to-day lives.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Illusion of the Self:** The teachings of non-duality, which emphasize that the self is an illusion created by the mind.  
- **Awareness vs. Consciousness:** Philosophies that distinguish between the pure Awareness that underlies all existence and the dynamic expression of that Awareness known as Consciousness.  
- **Spiritual Awakening Practices:** Techniques or methods used to facilitate deeper understanding of self and Awareness, such as mindfulness or meditation.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, which addresses the nature of self and reality.  
- **The Power of Now** by Eckhart Tolle, emphasizing the distinction between the mind and true self-awareness.  
- **The Open Secret** by Tony Parsons, which explores non-duality and the dissolution of the self.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can recognizing the illusory nature of the individual self deepen your relationship with the practice of satsang?
