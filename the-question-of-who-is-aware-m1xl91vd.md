**Note 2: The Inquiry of Awareness**  
**Title:** The Question of 'Who is Aware?'  
**Quote:** "So when you say ‘no one,’ it’s heard that there is no awareness of it."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When the participant responds with 'no one' as the answer to who is aware, it suggests a lack of a distinct observer acknowledging the experience.  
**Explanation:** This reflects a pivotal moment in the discussion, highlighting the intricate relationship between awareness and the self. In many contemplative practices, recognizing the absence of a perceiving entity can lead to significant revelations. It proposes that awareness itself might be a broader, more non-personal phenomenon, transcending individual identities. The idea that "no one" is aware could indicate a shift towards understanding awareness as a universal phenomenon rather than a personal trait. Thus, this notion challenges the conventional self-concept and encourages deeper self-inquiry, aimed at the realization of a more impersonally aware consciousness.  
**Connections:**  
- **Hindu Philosophy:** The concept of 'Brahman' as the ultimate, impersonal consciousness.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** These emphasize awareness without attachment to the identity of a 'self.'  
- **Contemplative Psychology:** Investigates how awareness exists independently of the constructed self within therapeutic settings.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself** by Michael A. Singer, focusing on releasing identification with the ego.  
- **Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality** by Anthony de Mello, which delves into mindfulness and self-awareness.  
- **The Book of Not Knowing** by Peter Ralston, an exploration of consciousness and self-awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What implications does the realization of 'no experiencer' have on your perceptions of reality and self?
