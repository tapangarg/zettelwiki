**Note 1: The Nature of the Self**  
**Title:** The Inquiry of ‘I’ and Awareness  
**Quote:** "I am aware. Who is this ‘I’?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** I have consciousness, but what exactly do I mean by ‘I’ in this state of awareness?  
**Explanation:** This excerpt prompts a deep existential inquiry into the essence of self-awareness. The distinction between the 'I' that is claiming awareness and the Awareness itself is critical to understanding one's conscious experience. This line of questioning indicates that the 'I' is more of an abstract concept rather than a concrete entity; it challenges the reader to discern whether the 'I' who observes is different from the state of pure awareness. The implication is that through this exploration, one may discover that the notion of ‘I’ is a fabricated identity rather than a representation of true consciousness. This distinction fosters growth on a spiritual level, leading to an understanding that can liberate the individual from the binds of ego and identity.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality:** The exploration of self in relation to Awareness relates closely to the philosophy of non-duality, where the distinction between subject and object dissolves.  
- **The Concept of Ego:** Psychological perspectives on the ego provide a juxtaposition to the inquiry, allowing for a broader understanding of identity.  
- **Zen Buddhism:** The practice of Zen emphasizes direct experience and the querying of selfhood, similar to the process outlined in this dialogue.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"I Am That" by Nisargadatta Maharaj:** A seminal text in non-dual spirituality that explores the nature of identity and consciousness.  
- **"The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle:** This work delves into the concept of being present and the differentiation between self and pure consciousness.  
- **"What Is Enlightenment?" by J. Krishnamurti:** A thought-provoking exploration of the nature of consciousness and self-inquiry.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What happens to my perception of self when I fully immerse in the experience of pure Awareness, devoid of the identity associated with the ‘I’?
