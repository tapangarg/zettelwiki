**Note 1: The Shift from Personal Struggles to Seeking Truth**  
**Title:** Transformation from Personal Desire to Quest for Truth  
**Quote:** "So when we fail at reaching happiness and peace from a personal perspective, then we become a seeker of what is called the Truth."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When we don’t find happiness and peace through our usual, personal means, we start searching for a deeper understanding of what is true and real.  
**Explanation:** This passage highlights a transformative journey often faced by individuals. Initially, one attempts to find happiness through conventional methods—career success, relationships, or personal achievements. However, upon realizing the futility of these pursuits, the individual becomes a seeker of Truth. This shift in focus marks a significant turning point where one begins to question the very fabric of their existence. It's not just about finding fleeting happiness anymore; it's about seeking a deeper, more enduring sense of peace and fulfillment. This quest leads to introspection and encourages the seeker to view their external circumstances as catalysts for internal growth. The world, once a source of suffering, transforms into a guiding force pointing towards deeper insights about oneself.
