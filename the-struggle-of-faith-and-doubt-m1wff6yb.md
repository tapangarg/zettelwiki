**Note 1: The Distress of Doubt in the Face of Heaven**  
**Title:** The Struggle of Faith and Doubt  
**Quote:** “that the thought of heaven, up until then so sweet to me, was no longer anything but the cause of struggle and torment” (S 333).  
**Translation into Modern English:** The idea of heaven, which once brought me joy, has now become a source of inner conflict and suffering.  

**Explanation:** Thérèse expresses the inner turmoil that arises when one grapples with doubt, particularly concerning the afterlife. This profound struggle emphasizes the often tumultuous nature of faith, illustrating that moments of doubt can overshadow prior beliefs, illustrating a significant aspect of spiritual growth.  

**Connections:**  
- **Faith in the Face of Doubt:** The narrative parallels many spiritual traditions that explore the theme of doubt as a natural part of faith (e.g., St. John of the Cross's “Dark Night of the Soul”).  
- **Existential Struggles:** The emotional experience resonates with philosophical inquiries regarding the nature of existence and belief.  
- **The Journey of the Heart:** Many mystics have reflected on their struggles as a means of deepening their relationship with the Divine.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **Dark Night of the Soul** by St. John of the Cross, which delves into the spiritual journey through doubt and darkness.  
- **The Wounded Healer** by Henri Nouwen, which explores the significance of suffering and healing in spiritual practice.  
- **The Power of Now** by Eckhart Tolle, featuring insights into overcoming doubt and embracing presence.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How does the experience of doubt challenge and ultimately enrich your spiritual journey?
