**Note 3: Experiencing Your Own Being**  
**Title:** Tasting Your Own Being  
**Quote:** "As we start to taste this moment, you start to taste Your own Being."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When we truly engage with the present, we begin to connect with the essence of who we are at our core.  

**Explanation:** The idea presented here is that the experience of the present moment is intricately tied to understanding our own essence or "Being." In tasting the moment without mental adornments, we come into contact with the fundamental aspects of our existence. Our Being is not separate from our experiences; rather, every encounter is a manifestation of our deeper self. This realization fosters self-awareness and a sense of connection to the universe, leading to a profound appreciation of existence. It encourages us to abandon superficial distractions to fully embrace and integrate our essence into our daily lives.  

**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality:** A philosophical and spiritual perspective that emphasizes the interconnectedness of all existence, blurring the divisions between self and other.  
- **Self-Realization:** The pursuit of understanding one's true nature and the essence that underlies all forms of existence.  
- **Neuroscience and Awareness:** Research on how attention and awareness influence our perception of reality and self-awareness.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj**, a compilation of dialogues that delve into self-realization and understanding one's true nature.  
- **The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success** by Deepak Chopra, which connects success to self-awareness and understanding of our deeper essence.  
- **Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality** by Anthony de Mello, discussing self-awareness and the impact of conscious living on understanding one's self.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing and engaging with your own Being affect your interactions with the world and your understanding of existence?
