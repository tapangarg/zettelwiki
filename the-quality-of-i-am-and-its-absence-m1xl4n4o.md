**Note 3: Existence Without Quality**  
**Title:** The Quality of 'I Am' and Its Absence  
**Quote:** "The sense that ‘I exist’ also was not present."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The awareness of simply existing, the 'I am,' is absent, indicating a state devoid of personal identity or attachment.  

**Explanation:** Here, the notion of existence is explored beyond the common understanding of conscious awareness. The speaker elucidates that in certain states, notably during deep sleep, even the fundamental awareness of 'I exist' is absent. This absence signifies a pure state of being — a state not marred by desires, fears, or identities. It emphasizes the idea that our existence can be conceptualized separate from the myriad identifiers we usually associate with 'I', suggesting a more profound, unconditioned state of being that is important for spiritual growth and self-discovery.

**Connections:**  
- **Non-duality:** Teaching found in various spiritual traditions indicating that true self-realization transcends the duality of 'I' and 'not I'.  
- **Phenomenology of Perception:** Merleau-Ponty's work explores perception without the interference of identified self, shaping how we understand existence.  
- **Mystical Experiences:** Literature on mystical experiences often describes states of being where individual identity dissolves into a universal consciousness.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, which discusses non-duality and the realization of the self beyond thought and identity.  
- **The Tao Te Ching** by Lao Tzu, which touches upon the nature of existence and being without attachment.  
- **The Myth of Sisyphus** by Albert Camus, which reflects on existence, absurdism, and how one arrives at meaning without define identity.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How can the exploration of existence absent of identity challenge your perspectives on consciousness, and what implications does it have for your daily life?
