**Note 1: The Nature of Awareness**  
**Title:** Awareness Beyond Spatial Constraints  
**Quote:** "So, we say that there is Awareness. So the question is ‘So, where is Awareness?’ We say ‘There is Awareness’. So I’m saying ‘Where is Awareness?’"  
**Translation into Modern English:** We affirm the existence of Awareness, but we must explore the question of its location. What does it mean to say that Awareness exists? It prompts us to question where exactly it resides.  
**Explanation:** The dialogue delves into a critical inquiry: the understanding of Awareness transcends mere spatial terms. The speaker emphasizes that instead of thinking of Awareness in terms of physical direction (left, right, up, down), it exists independently of those spatial dimensions. This concept encourages us to realize that while we often search for external answers or locations, Awareness is a more profound, intrinsic quality that operates outside conventional parameters of space and time. In this sense, Awareness isn’t about where it is, but rather what it is—a fundamental aspect of existence itself. Understanding this leads to a richer comprehension of consciousness and the self.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality:** This discussion relates closely to non-dual spiritual traditions, which assert that the self and the universe are interconnected and that perceived separations are illusions.
- **Mindfulness:** The practice of mindfulness emphasizes being aware of the present moment, often guiding individuals to recognize Awareness as an ongoing experience rather than a spatial concept.
- **Eastern Philosophies of Self:** Many Eastern philosophies, including Buddhism, grapple with the notion of self and Awareness, suggesting that the fundamental nature of self does not tether to physical definitions.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment** by Eckhart Tolle, which explores the importance of being present and understanding the essence of consciousness.  
- **I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj**, which discusses non-dual awareness and consciousness beyond physical forms and boundaries.  
- **Self-Inquiry: The Direct Path** by Greg Goode, which provides insights into Ramana Maharshi's teachings on who we really are, separated from constructs of identity.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can shifting our understanding of Awareness from a spatial concept to a deeper realization affect our daily lives and spiritual practices?
