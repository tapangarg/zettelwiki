**Note 3: The Quest for the True Self**  
**Title:** The Search for True Identity Beyond Thoughts  
**Quote:** "So, who is this one that is concerned? That is the one we looked for."  
**Translation into Modern English:** We inquire about the identity behind our thoughts and concerns, seeking to uncover the genuine self that is aware.  
**Explanation:** The question posed signals a profound inquiry into the nature of self beyond the mental constructs we typically identify with. It suggests an exploration into the essence of consciousness itself, seeking to uncover that which perceives, experiences, and reacts without the complications of identity. By engaging in this search, individuals can encounter a more authentic version of themselves, one that transcends societal programming, fears, and desires manifested by the mind. Engaging in such inquiries can pave the way for profound shifts in self-understanding, leading to freedom from limiting beliefs and fostering a sense of unity with existence.  
**Connections:**  
- **Inner Work Practices:** Such as journaling or meditation, which aim to excavate deeper aspects of identity and conscious experience.    
- **Existential Psychology:** Which probes the questions of existence, identity, and meaning, examining the factors that constitute the self.  
- **Transpersonal Psychology:** This field explores beyond the ego and individual identity, often involving spiritual experiences or revelations.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose:** By Eckhart Tolle, which encourages readers to explore their identities beyond the ego.  
- **The Seeker's Guide to Reincarnation:** By David L. Black, which discusses the spiritual journey towards understanding the nature of self.  
- **Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma:** By Peter A. Levine, which explores the journey of the self through trauma in relation to identity.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What does it mean to you when you consider the notion of self as a fluid concept rather than a fixed entity, and how does this understanding influence your daily interactions and sense of purpose?
