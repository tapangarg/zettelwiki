**Note 3: The Process of Observing Without Labeling**  
**Title:** The Practice of Observational Awareness  
**Quote:** "And if the labeling comes, let the labeling come and go; donâ€™t try to stop the mind."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When thoughts emerge that attempt to label our experiences, we should allow them to arise and pass without resistance.  
**Explanation:** The speaker underscores the importance of observational awareness, encouraging participants to engage with their surrounding objects without imposing labels or judgments. This practice contributes to a state of clarity and peace, as it supports a flow of awareness that is unhampered by the habitual categorization of experiences. By watching thoughts and labels arise and dissolve, one learns to observe the mind's tendencies and, in turn, cultivates a deeper sense of presence and acceptance. This practice is significant as it nurtures an inner stillness and connection with the present moment, which is foundational for deeper spiritual growth and understanding.

- **Vipassana Meditation:** This ancient meditation technique teaches observation of breath and sensations without labeling.
