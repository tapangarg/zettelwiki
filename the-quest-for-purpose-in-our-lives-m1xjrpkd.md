**Note 2: Understanding the Purpose of Existence**  
**Title:** The Quest for Purpose in Our Lives  
**Quote:** "Many have asked this question in satsang as to ‘What is the purpose? What is the purpose of this universe?’"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Many have pondered and discussed in spiritual gatherings the fundamental question: 'What is the purpose of life and the universe?'  
**Explanation:** This inquiry into the purpose of existence is a deeply philosophical question that transcends cultures and epochs. Such existential questions can lead to profound insights about our passions, visions, and the drive behind our actions. The nature of this quest for purpose can dictate how we approach happiness and fulfillment. However, this exploration must consider the source of the questioning – whether it arises from an external or internal perspective. If we view purpose from a personal lens, it could distort our understanding by rooting our happiness in external validation, often leading to disappointment when these expectations are not met. Thus, examining the origin of our questions regarding purpose is essential as we navigate our growth and understanding of life.
