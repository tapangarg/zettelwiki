**Note 1: The Centrality of Choice**  
**Title:** The Importance of Daily Choices in Spiritual Life  
**Quote:** "Thérèse emphasizes this word several times... the whole Bible is one long sermon on the word Choose."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Thérèse repeatedly highlights the significance of the act of choosing, which is underscored by the belief that throughout the Bible, the core message revolves around the notion of choice.  
**Explanation:** The text underscores choice as a fundamental aspect of human existence, mirrored in the Biblical narrative. Choices shape our identity and path toward love and faithfulness. Each decision we make either brings us closer to divine love or distances us from it, making choices integral to our spiritual journey.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Concept of Free Will in Theology:** This connects to discussions about how free will allows individuals to engage with God or pursue their own paths.  
- **Moral Philosophy on Decision-Making:** Ethical theories often explore how choices define character and values, paralleling Thérèse's views.  
- **Daily Spiritual Practices:** Engaging in daily reflections or prayers can help individuals become more conscious of their choices, guiding them toward love.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Choice and the Will of God:** By John Stott, exploring the relationship between human choice and divine providence.  
- **The Freedom of a Christian:** By Martin Luther, discussing the interplay of free will and grace in the life of a believer.  
- **The Art of Choosing:** By Sheena Iyengar, which examines decision-making processes in personal and cultural contexts.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How do the everyday choices you make reflect your values and relationship with divinity, and how can you become more intentional in this process?
