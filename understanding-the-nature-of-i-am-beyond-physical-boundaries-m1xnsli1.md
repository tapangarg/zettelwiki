**Note 1: The Distinction Between 'I Am' and Body Sensations**  
**Title:** Understanding the Nature of 'I Am' Beyond Physical Boundaries  
**Quote:** "But actually you are experiencing the sensations and the visuals of the body within this ‘I Am’. And if you can check... find out where the sensations in the body are happening?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** You may think that your sense of 'I Am' is contained within your body, but the sensations and visuals of the body are actually perceived within the broader experience of 'I Am'. At this moment, take a moment to notice where in your body you feel sensations.  
**Explanation:** This note explores the fundamental nature of self-awareness and identity. The author highlights that while we often think of our identity as being bound to the physicality of our bodies, the actual experience of 'I Am' transcends these physical boundaries. 'I Am' encompasses a wider awareness that cannot be confined to spatial limits like the body. By asking individuals to investigate where sensations arise, an opportunity is presented to discern that body experiences are just one aspect of a more profound existence. This understanding can liberate individuals from the confines of their physical forms and expand their self-concept beyond tangible boundaries. It encourages a deeper exploration of consciousness and existence, inviting inquiry into what it truly means to 'be'.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality:** The concept of non-duality suggests that there is no separation between self and the universe. Understanding 'I Am' in this context invites exploration of how individuals may perceive their existence as separate or whole.  
- **Mind-Body Dualism:** This note pivots on the problems of dualistic thinking, encouraging a reevaluation of how we see body and mind in relationship to identity.  
- **Buddhist Notion of Anatta (Non-Self):** The idea that there is no permanent self mirrors this exploration of feeling and experience beyond physical senses.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment** by Eckhart Tolle, focusing on the essence of being and presence.  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, which discusses the nature of consciousness and self.  
- **Being Nobody, Going Nowhere: Meditations on the Buddhist Path** by Ayya Khema, exploring the relationship between self and experience.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing that sensations occur within a larger sense of 'I Am' change your understanding of self and your relationship to your body and existence?
