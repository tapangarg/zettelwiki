Note 3: Contemplation as an Inner Journey  
**Title:** The Art of Deep Contemplation  
**Quote:** "Contemplation: Contemplation is a non-intellectual looking as one follows the teacher’s pointings inwardly."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Contemplation involves a deep, non-intellectual exploration guided by a teacher’s insights, aimed at looking inward.  
**Explanation:** Contemplation is more than mere reflection; it is a profound inward journey that encourages surrendering to the process rather than seeking immediate answers. This practice is fundamental in various spiritual traditions, fostering deeper insights and a more profound connection with one's own essence. By allowing questions to emerge without force, practitioners may experience shifts in perception that can lead to the dissolution of ego and a deeper understanding of their true nature. This process encourages liberation from the constraints of the mind and a sense of peace and clarity.  
**Connections:**  
- **Meditation Practices:** Similar to contemplative practices, many forms of meditation aim to quiet the mind and focus inward.  
- **Mindfulness:** The act of present-moment awareness, nurturing an openness to insights as they arise without judgment.  
- **Mystical Experiences:** Encounters in various spiritual traditions where individuals report profound revelations after extended periods of contemplation.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching:** By Thich Nhat Hanh, highlighting the practice of mindfulness and ethical living as a mode of contemplation.  
- **Contemplative Practices in Action:** By Patricia O’Connell Killen, exploring various forms of contemplation across different traditions.  
- **The Wisdom of No Escape:** By Pema Chödrön, which emphasizes the importance of embracing experience through contemplation and awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How might the practice of contemplation transform your understanding and relationship with your inner self?
