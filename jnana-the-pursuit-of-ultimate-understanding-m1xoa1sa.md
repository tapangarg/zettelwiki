This pursuit is akin to peeling away layers of false identification, moving toward an unalterable truth. As seekers embrace this path, they uncover wisdom that informs every aspect of their lives, thus nurturing their spiritual evolution. Understanding jnana is vital for anyone on a quest for self-knowledge and liberation.
