**Note 3: Facing the Mirror in Spiritual Enquiry**  
**Title:** The Mirror of Self-Discovery in Satsang  
**Quote:** "When you come to satsang... you are shown a mirror or you are invited actually to see the mirror."  
**Translation into Modern English:** In spiritual gatherings, you are often encouraged to reflect on yourself and your true nature.  
**Explanation:** The notion of being shown a mirror during satsang suggests that these gatherings are not merely about receiving teachings but rather about self-reflection and discovering oneâ€™s true self. The mirror symbolizes truth and self-awareness, prompting individuals to confront and question their identities and beliefs. This process of introspection is paramount to spiritual growth, as it invites individuals to go beyond superficial desires and face their inner truths. Engaging with this reflection can lead to profound realizations and shifts in perspective, ultimately dismantling preconceived notions of the self and fostering deeper understanding.
