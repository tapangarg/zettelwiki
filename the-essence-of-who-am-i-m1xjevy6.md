**Note 2: The Nature of Inquiry**  
**Title:** The Essence of ‘Who Am I?’  
**Quote:** “Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi's repeated advice to inquire ‘Who Am I?’ and Nisargadatta Maharaj's guidance to stay with the sense ‘I Am’ was not so that one day they could say ‘Fooled you!’”  
**Translation into Modern English:** The persistent encouragement from Ramana Maharshi to delve into the question ‘Who Am I?’ along with Nisargadatta Maharaj's advice to maintain focus on the feeling of ‘I Am’ was not intended as a joke or trick.  
**Explanation:** The essence of self-inquiry, as taught by these spiritual masters, invites a genuine introspection rather than an escapade into confusion. The inquiry into ‘Who Am I?’ is a profound practice that encourages individuals to peel back layers of identity, ego, and preconceived notions about oneself. This guiding principle is not meant to lead to a dead-end of frustration but rather to reveal the fundamental aspects of existence and consciousness that lie beneath the surface. Through this inquiry, practitioners are offered the chance to encounter a more authentic self, transcending the superficial constructs that often define human experience.  
**Connections:**  
- **Self-Enquiry in Spiritual Traditions:** Similar practices in other traditions, such as Sufism's path of self-discovery and existential inquiries in Western philosophy, expose the universality of the question.  
- **Mindfulness and Presence:** The invitation to focus on the present moment resonates with the requirement to stay with the sense of ‘I Am’, as mindfulness opens pathways to awareness.  
- **Philosophical Foundations of the Self:** The exploration of identity in existential philosophy parallels the spiritual inquiry, questioning the essence of being.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **“The Quest for the Ultimate Truth” by Ramesh Balsekar:** This text delves into teachings on self-inquiry and understanding consciousness.  
- **“The Heart of Awareness” by Mipham Rinpoche:** A work that connects mindfulness practices with deeper inquiries into self-perception.  
- **“The Ground of Your Being” by Paul T. P. K. Korosec:** This explores self-inquiry in depth, intertwining spiritual and psychological explorations.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can the practice of deep inquiry alter our perceptions of identity and reality, leading to transformative experiences in our daily lives?
