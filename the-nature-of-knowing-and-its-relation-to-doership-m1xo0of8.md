**Note 2: The Quest for Knowing and Doership**  
**Title:** The Nature of Knowing and Its Relation to Doership  
**Quote:** "I really donâ€™t know anything at the moment... I wanted to look closer with you on doership, what is going on."  
**Translation into Modern English:** I'm currently in a state of confusion and uncertainty about my knowledge, and my intention is to delve deeper into the concept of doership and what it entails.  
**Explanation:** The speaker expresses a state of inquiry concerning their understanding of 'knowing' and the nature of doership. This discernment suggests an openness to explore the complexities of action, intention, and knowledge. In various philosophical traditions, the idea of doership relates to the understanding of one's agency and the illusion of control, questioning whether we are truly the authors of our actions or are merely responding to larger forces at play. This nuanced exploration is significant, as it invites individuals to reflect on their perceived roles and responsibilities in life, leading to deeper self-awareness and existential inquiry.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality in Advaita Vedanta:** The philosophy that emphasizes the unity of existence and challenges the perception of individual doership.  
- **Existentialism:** Philosophical inquiries into the nature of existence, freedom, and responsibility may offer insights into the complex relationship between knowing and action.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques that emphasize awareness of the present moment can help develop an understanding of doership and the nature of thoughts and actions.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, where non-dual awareness and the illusion of individual agency are discussed.  
- **Being and Nothingness** by Jean-Paul Sartre, which delves into existentialist themes and the nature of being and action.  
- **The Miracle of Mindfulness** by Thich Nhat Hanh, which offers practical ways to understand and practice mindful awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways does the exploration of your own understanding of knowing and doership reshape your perception of agency and intention in your daily life?
