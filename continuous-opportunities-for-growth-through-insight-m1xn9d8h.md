**Explanation:** The author emphasizes the notion that life is a continuous source of fresh insights and learning opportunities. There should never be a claim to lack new understanding; instead, life constantly offers avenues for deeper exploration and growth. This perspective encourages the embrace of each moment, suggesting that every experience can lead to a new level of awareness or understanding. Life isn't static; it's a dynamic interplay of experiences that invites us to delve deeper into the mysteries we face. Recognizing this helps us maintain an open mind and a willingness to learn, fostering an attitude that is essential for personal advancement and enlightenment.
