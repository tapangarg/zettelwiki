**Note 3: The Recognition of True Self and Emptiness**  
**Title:** The Quest for Emptiness Following Self-Recognition  
**Quote:** "But then how do I come to this emptiness?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Upon recognizing what I am, the question arises: what does it mean to experience this sense of emptiness that comes with it?  
**Explanation:** This dialogue highlights the paradox encountered after self-recognition; the individual seeks 'emptiness' or detachment from conditioned identities. True self-recognition may lead to an awareness of the transient nature of the self, prompting one to explore the concept of emptiness. This emptiness does not signify a void but rather an expansive state of awareness where one is liberated from clinging to identities shaped by thoughts and judgments. Only those who have glimpsed their genuine essence can genuinely pursue the emptiness that accompanies awakening. This represents a significant milestone in spiritual development, marking a shift toward a more expansive understanding of existence.  
**Connections:**
