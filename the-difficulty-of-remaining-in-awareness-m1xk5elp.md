**Note 2: The Challenge of Sustained Awareness**  
**Title:** The Difficulty of Remaining in Awareness  
**Quote:** "I would have neither the attention span nor the patience to just stay with the ‘I Am’ all the time."  
**Translation into Modern English:** I find it challenging to maintain my focus on the essence of ‘I Am’ consistently, lacking both the concentration and the endurance to do so.  
**Explanation:** This reflects the common struggle many individuals face in cultivating and sustaining a state of Awareness. The struggle may arise from the demands of modern life, distractions, and an incessant thought process that tends to blur the clarity of one's existence. The passage emphasizes that while prolonged attention to the 'I Am' may seem difficult and unattainable, it is not a necessary requirement for enlightenment or realization of the Self. Foundations in various spiritual traditions suggest that this realization can arise at any moment and does not require intense effort; instead, it encourages individuals to embrace spontaneity in their journey toward self-awareness.  
**Connections:**  
- **Simplicity in Spiritual Practice:** Many teachings emphasize the need for simplicity in approaching spirituality, highlighting that even fleeting moments of Awareness can lead to profound realizations.  
- **Flow State:** The concept of being in a 'flow state' where one is deeply engaged in the present moment aligns closely with the experiences of sustained Awareness.  
- **Instantaneous Enlightenment:** Various philosophies suggest that realization can occur suddenly without prolonged practice, illustrating an alternative perspective on spiritual growth.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind** by Shunryu Suzuki, which discusses simplicity in Zen practice and cultivating presence.  
- **The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself** by Michael A. Singer, exploring the nature of self and the experience of consciousness.  
- **The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching** by Thich Nhat Hanh, addressing mindfulness and the importance of Awareness in Buddhism.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What would happen if you allowed yourself to experience moments of Awareness without the pressure to sustain them indefinitely?
