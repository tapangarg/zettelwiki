**Note 3: Communicating from the Now**

**Title:** The Challenge of Speaking from the Present Moment

**Quote:** "‘Okay, speak from the Now.’ And then I can immediately see that the attention is going to the mind."

**Translation into Modern English:** When prompted to communicate from the present moment, it becomes apparent that people often become distracted by their thoughts.

**Explanation:** This statement addresses the struggle many have in staying present during conversations. When asked to 'speak from the Now,' individuals find it difficult to disengage from their mental chatter, which often undermines authentic communication. This tendency to revert to thoughts can lead to misunderstandings and prevent genuine connection. The requirement to snap one's fingers as a reminder signifies the urgency and difficulty of this practice. It draws attention to our ingrained habits of mind, which can overshadow real-time interaction and prevent a deep engagement with both our experiences and those of others. Understanding this can reveal the importance of mindfulness in communication, as well as the need for tools to anchor ourselves in the present.
