**Note 1: The Comfort of the Familiar and the Fear of the Unknown**

**Title:** Clinging to Familiarity and Avoiding the Unknown

**Quote:** "All of us are like Thérèse. In order to feel secure we cling to the familiar."

**Explanation:** Thérèse's reaction to her mother's death is reflective of a common human tendency: the instinct to find security in the familiar. This reaction can manifest in various ways, such as preferring the company of family or sticking to certain routines to avoid anxiety or discomfort. The text emphasizes that while this instinct for security is deeply ingrained, it is often in tension with the innate drive to grow. The fear of stepping into the unknown can limit our potential and stifle growth, a struggle represented by the poem "George Gray." Ultimately, the text suggests that choosing courage in the face of fear is essential for finding meaning and fulfillment in life.
