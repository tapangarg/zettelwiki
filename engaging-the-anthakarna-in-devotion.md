**Note 2: The Role of the Anthakarna in Prayer**  
**Title:** Engaging the Anthakarna in Devotion  
**Quote:** "We can never say just mind is enough. Just intellect is enough. Everything to God or nothing to the world..."  
**Translation into Modern English:** We cannot rely solely on one aspect of the mind; we must dedicate the entirety of our being to God or nothing at all.  
**Explanation:** This quote emphasizes the importance of nurturing all aspects of the Anthakarna—mind, intellect, memory, feelings, and heart—in the practice of prayer. A holistic engagement with these elements ensures a profound connection with the Divine. It symbolizes the necessity of integrating our mental, emotional, and spiritual selves into a single devotional act.
