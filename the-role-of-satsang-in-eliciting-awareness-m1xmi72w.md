**Note 3: Engaging with Satsang**  
**Title:** The Role of Satsang in Eliciting Awareness  
**Quote:** "Just the other day I was saying ‘What about this space in which all these movements and emotions and thoughts are happening? Can we bring a little bit of attention to that space?’"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Recently, I reflected on the importance of considering the deeper space that encompasses all of our experiences—can we focus our attention on this foundational awareness?  

**Explanation:** The mention of "satsang" highlights the value of gathering in a community to explore shared spiritual insights and deepen understanding. Here, the focus is on directing attention toward the sacred space—the awareness that exists beyond transient thoughts and emotions. Engaging with others during satsang offers a supportive atmosphere to contemplate these deeper realities, fostering growth while encouraging individuals to consider what lies beneath their everyday experiences. This shared exploration cultivates a sense of connection and collective understanding, enhancing personal insights into one's nature and the nature of reality.
