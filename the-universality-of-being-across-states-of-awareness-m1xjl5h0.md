**Note 3: Presence in Different States of Mind**  
**Title:** The Universality of Being Across States of Awareness  
**Quote:** "This Being is ever-present. In the waking state and the dream state, this Being is always present."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The sense of Being exists continuously, regardless of whether one is awake or dreaming.  
**Explanation:** The assertion that Being persists regardless of one's state—waking or dreaming—illustrates a key aspect of consciousness. This notion highlights that the essence of existence is not contingent upon our experiences or perceptions; it remains consistent as an underlying reality. Recognizing this omnipresence of Beings in various states of awareness allows individuals to cultivate a steady sense of self and understanding of reality. It encourages understanding how our experiences, whether joyful or painful, do not detract from this fundamental experience of Being that transcends the fluctuations of our mental states.  
**Connections:**  
- **Dream Yoga:** A practice in Tibetan Buddhism that teaches one to maintain awareness of the dream state as it parallels the waking state.  
- **Lucid Dreaming:** The phenomenon of being aware that you are dreaming, emphasizing the continuity of states of perception.  
- **Transcendental Awareness in Mystical Experiences:** Many mystics describe experiences of pure Being irrespective of their physical or mental states, touching upon an eternal aspect of consciousness.
