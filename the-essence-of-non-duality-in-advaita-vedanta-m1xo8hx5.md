**Note 1: Understanding Advaita Vedanta**  
**Title:** The Essence of Non-Duality in Advaita Vedanta  
**Quote:** "Advaita Vedanta: Literally ‘not two’; non-duality or absolute unity."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Advaita Vedanta translates to ‘not two’, signifying the philosophical concept of non-duality or the idea of absolute unity in existence.  
**Explanation:** Advaita Vedanta is a spiritual and philosophical approach rooted in the Vedic texts of India that posits the ultimate reality as being Brahman, a singular, unchanging essence underlying all that exists. It emphasizes that the apparent diversity of the world and the individual self (the conceptual self) is ultimately illusory. The significance of understanding this notion lies in its power to liberate individuals from the confines of dualistic thinking, thereby fostering a profound sense of connectedness and unity with all existence. This realization is pivotal in spiritual growth, filtering through various aspects of life and enhancing one’s perception of reality.  
**Connections:**  
- **Maya:** The concept of illusion in Hindu philosophy, which explains the nature of the perceived world as transient and ultimately unreal.  
- **Brahman and Atman:** The relationship between the ultimate reality (Brahman) and the individual soul (Atman) in Advaita Vedanta, highlighting the non-separation between the two.  
- **Zen Buddhism's Non-Duality:** The parallels between Advaita Vedanta and Zen Buddhism regarding the understanding of reality and the self can lead to deeper insights into non-dual awareness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"I Am That" by Nisargadatta Maharaj:** A collection of dialogues that elucidates the fundamental concepts of non-duality in Advaita Vedanta.  
- **"The Upanishads":** A compilation of ancient texts that delve into the philosophy of Brahman and Atman and provide foundational teachings of Advaita Vedanta.  
- **"The Heart of Awareness: A Translation of the Ashtavakra Gita":** This text illustrates the principles of non-duality and liberation through self-realization.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does the perception of reality as non-dual transform our engagement with the world and influence our spiritual practice?
