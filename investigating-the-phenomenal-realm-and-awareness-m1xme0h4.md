**Note 1: Inquiry into Awareness**  
**Title:** Investigating the Phenomenal Realm and Awareness  
**Quote:** "What is here now in the seeming-phenomenal realm which is the most like Awareness?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** What exists in this observable world that closely resembles Awareness?  
**Explanation:** The text prompts a profound inquiry into the nature of Awareness by encouraging an exploration of the present moment and the elements of the phenomenal world that might embody the qualities of Awareness. The author characterizes Awareness as attribute-less, devoid of specific properties such as color, flavor, or feeling, and invites the reader to seek out something in their immediate experience that mirrors this essence. This inquiry is significant because it not only emphasizes the observer's ability to identify qualities akin to Awareness in their surroundings but also challenges normative perceptions of existence, thereby encouraging deeper introspection and self-discovery. By recognizing attributes that reflect Awareness, we potentially connect with a truer aspect of consciousness, pointing to a deeper understanding of our being.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Dual Awareness:** The philosophical concept in many Eastern traditions that emphasizes the oneness of awareness and existence, where the observer and the observed are not separate.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques that focus on being present in the moment and noticing without attachment, which aligns with the idea of identifying qualities of Awareness in our experiences.  
- **Philosophy of Being:** The exploration of what it means to 'be' or 'exist,' often discussed in existential philosophy, which relates to concepts such as 'Beingness' mentioned in the text.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment** by Eckhart Tolle, which delves into the importance of present-moment awareness.  
- **I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj**, a collection of conversations that explore non-dual awareness and the nature of consciousness.  
- **The Book of Awakening: Having the Life You Want by Being Present to the Life You Have** by Mark Nepo, which offers insights into mindfulness and present-awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What aspects of your immediate experience can you identify that resonate with the qualities of Awareness, and how does this recognition influence your understanding of your own consciousness?
