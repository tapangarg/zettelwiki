**Note 1: The Inquiry into the Nature of 'I'**  
**Title:** Investigating the Self: Who is the 'I' that is Aware?  
**Quote:** "Who is this ‘I’ that is aware? [Silence] Is this ‘I’ an object?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** The contemplation begins by asking, "What is this 'I' that possesses awareness?" It follows with a moment of silence to reflect on whether this 'I' can be defined as an object.  
**Explanation:** This inquiry challenges the seeker to delve into the true essence of self-awareness, pushing aside distractions and superficial thoughts that surface during contemplation. The questioning begins with a simple yet profound exploration of identity—who or what is the 'I' that is aware of thoughts and experiences? It is inviting us to remain in a suspension of conclusions and idle speculations, thus tapping into deeper layers of understanding. By refusing to label or define the 'I' with attributes typically associated with physicality—such as shape, size, or temporality—the inquiry directs us to an introspective awareness that is not bound by the constructs of the mind or material perceptions. This process of inquiry is crucial in the journey of self-realization, as it can lead to the ultimate insight into our true nature and existence beyond the ego.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Dualism:** This exploration points to the principles of non-dualism, where the distinction between the observer and the observed dissolves, revealing oneness.  
- **Buddhist Concepts of Anatta (Non-Self):** The inquiry resonates with the Buddhist understanding that there is no permanent self, challenging the solidified notion of identity.  
- **Socratic Method of Inquiry:** The method of persistent questioning, akin to Socrates' approach, serves to peel away layers of false identity to unveil deeper truths.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"I Am That" by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj:** A compilation of dialogues that deeply explore the nature of self and awareness.  
- **"The Heart of the Buddha’s Teaching" by Thich Nhat Hanh:** This work elucidates concepts of self, interbeing, and the nature of perception from a Buddhist standpoint.  
- **"The Book of Not Knowing" by Peter Ralston:** This book delves into the philosophical inquiries about our existence and consciousness, promoting self-awareness without predefined assumptions.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What happens when I let go of all assumptions and categorizations of the 'I' and simply rest in the inquiry of my existence?
