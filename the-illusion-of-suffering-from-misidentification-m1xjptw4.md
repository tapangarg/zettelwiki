**Note 2: The Nature of Suffering from Belief in Appearance**

**Title:** The Illusion of Suffering from Misidentification

**Quote:** "anytime you give your belief to something which says ‘You are just an appearance’ then you are picking up this ‘pretend’ suffering."

**Translation into Modern English:** Whenever you start believing that your identity is solely tied to your appearances, you begin to experience unnecessary suffering.

**Explanation:** This statement points out the suffering that arises from the mistaken belief that we are merely our thoughts, feelings, and external circumstances—what is termed as 'appearance.' When we identify with these transient aspects of our existence, we inadvertently accept suffering as part of our reality. This suffering is described as 'pretend' because it is rooted in a misunderstanding of our true nature. By holding onto the belief that we are confined to appearances, we reinforce a sense of separation from our true selves, which is infinitely more expansive and free. Recognizing that we are Awareness allows us to detach from this self-imposed suffering and live from a place of deeper understanding and acceptance.
