**Note 3: The Nature of Awareness**  
**Title:** The Unborn and Unchanging Awareness  
**Quote:** "Awareness: That which is unborn and unchanging; the Self."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Awareness is characterized as something that has no beginning or end and remains constant; it represents our true essence, the Self.  
**Explanation:** Awareness is the fundamental state of existence, which transcends the fluctuations of thought, emotion, and sensory experience. It is often described as the witness or observer that remains unmoved by the ever-changing phenomena of life. Recognizing this aspect of ourselves is crucial for spiritual growth, as it enables a deeper understanding of our true nature beyond the ego and mind. Acknowledging that the essence of who we are does not change creates a profound shift in perspective, allowing us to navigate life's challenges with greater equanimity and insight.
