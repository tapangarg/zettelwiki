**Note 2: The Concept of 'I Am'**  
**Title:** 'I Am' - The First Expression of Existence  
**Quote:** "Because nobody can say that in sleep state there is noise, in deep sleep there is nothing at all."  
**Translation into Modern English:** During deep sleep, there is no noise, and one cannot assert their existence. Hence, the state of 'I Am' is crucial as the first conscious experience upon waking.  

**Explanation:** The idea of 'I Am' emerges as the fundamental awareness of existence. It marks the transition from the absence of conscious experience (such as in deep sleep) to the recognition of being awake. This 'I Am' consciousness is vital as it initiates all other experiences and manifestations of our reality. Understanding this principle is paramount for individual understanding, as it delineates the onset of awareness from oblivion and emphasizes the importance of recognizing one's own fundamental existence. 

**Connections:**  
- **Existential Philosophy:** Explores the essence of being and the question of existence ('I think, therefore I am' by Descartes).  
- **Non-Dual Spirituality:** Various teachings also discuss the idea of oneness and self-awareness, which aligns with the notion of 'I Am' as a primary identity.  
- **The Bhagavad Gita:** Discusses self-awareness and realization, connecting with the concept of understanding one's essence as ‘I Am.’  

**Further Reading:**  
- **Being and Time** by Martin Heidegger, focusing on the nature of being and existence.  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, which explores consciousness and self-identity from a non-dual perspective.  
- **The Tao of Pooh** by Benjamin Hoff, providing insights on existential understanding through a light-hearted lens.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How does the recognition of ‘I Am’ as the fundamental aspect of your being shift your understanding of self and your connection to the rest of existence?
