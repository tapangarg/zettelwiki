**Note 2: The Challenge of Expressing Awareness**  
**Title:** The Discomfort of Articulating Present Awareness  
**Quote:** "Father, that one, you know, the answer doesn’t come out. There is some peace, there is some contentment, but I don’t know about that."  
**Translation into Modern English:** I find it difficult to express my current awareness. While there is a sense of tranquility and satisfaction, articulating this awareness eludes me.  
**Explanation:** This statement encapsulates a common experience in spiritual practice: the struggle to articulate one's inner state of being. The respondent acknowledges a peaceful state yet finds it challenging to express or describe this experience. This highlights a fundamental aspect of the contemplative journey: the complexities of verbalizing inner realizations or states of awareness. There is often a gap between the experience of peace or clarity and the ability to share it in words. This is significant for personal growth as it points to the necessity of silent awareness and suggests that true understanding may lie beyond verbal expression. Embracing this discomfort can help cultivate a greater acceptance of one’s inner experiences without the pressure of needing to define or explain them fully.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Limits of Language in Spiritual Expression:** Many philosophical texts explore the inadequacy of language in encapsulating profound states of awareness and consciousness.  
- **Non-verbal Communication of Inner States:** The use of art, music, and other non-verbal expressions to convey awareness can provide alternatives to articulate one’s experiences more authentically.  
- **The Role of Meditation in Discovering Silent Awareness:** Meditation practices emphasize that silence can often lead to profound insights that words cannot capture.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Zen Teachings of Bodhidharma** which discusses the nature of awareness and expressions of it in meditation.  
- **The Art of Happiness** by the Dalai Lama and Howard Cutler, touching on inner peace and its complex verbalizations.  
- **Being There: Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again** by Andy Clark, exploring how reality and language intersect with awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can we learn to embrace the silence within our awareness instead of feeling compelled to vocalize it in order to validate our experiences?
