Note 2: Integrity in Exploration  
**Title:** The Necessity of Integrity in Self-Inquiry  
**Quote:** "As long as it is not that, then you must have this integrity to look."  
**Translation into Modern English:** While your perception and understanding do not align with the realization of non-phenomenality, you must commit to examining your experiences honestly.  
**Explanation:** Integrity plays a crucial role in the process of self-inquiry. The statement urges individuals to be steadfast and honest in their introspection as they journey toward deeper understanding. It implies that until one reaches the profound insight of non-phenomenality, it is vital to engage earnestly with one's experiences, questioning the significance of various aspects of existence, which often include the challenges and narratives surrounding personal relationships, societal pressures, and physical existence. This integrity enables individuals to confront their conditioning and biases, ultimately leading to authentic insights and personal growth.
