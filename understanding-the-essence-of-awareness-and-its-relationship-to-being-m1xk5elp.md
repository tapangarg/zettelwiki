**Note 1: The Nature of Awareness and Being**  
**Title:** Understanding the Essence of Awareness and Its Relationship to Being  
**Quote:** "Then you say ‘As Being, then let me stay as Being’. Stay as God."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When you acknowledge your existence as 'Being', you are encouraged to remain in that state, which is akin to being with God.  
**Explanation:** This passage explores the fundamental concepts of Awareness and Being, suggesting that true existence transcends the active perception of oneself. Instead of becoming lost in the complexities of thought or identity, one is urged to realize their true nature by simply 'being'—that is, to recognize the state of Awareness which directly reveals one's essence. This realization is essential as it shifts focus from merely existing to embodying the state of Awareness that is always present and can lead to a profound inner peace and spiritual liberation. Understanding this distinction fosters a deeper growth, as it encourages individuals to explore their consciousness beyond egoistic or transient thoughts.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Concept of Non-duality:** Many philosophical systems, particularly in Eastern traditions, delve into the idea that Awareness and Being are inseparable, promoting the understanding of an undivided reality.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Modern mindfulness techniques echo this awareness of the present moment and can assist individuals in connecting with their true essence.  
- **Existential Philosophy:** Thinkers like Martin Heidegger have explored themes of 'Being', providing a philosophical backdrop to Understanding Awareness and existence.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment** by Eckhart Tolle, discussing the importance of presence and Awareness.  
- **I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj**, a profound exploration of non-duality and the nature of the self.  
- **Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality** by Anthony de Mello, dealing with the spiritual implications of Awareness in daily life.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How might shifting your focus from identifying with ‘Being’ to embracing pure Awareness alter your perception of self and existence?
