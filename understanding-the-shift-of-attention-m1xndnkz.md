**Note 1: The Nature of Attention**  
**Title:** Understanding the Shift of Attention  
**Quote:** "The shift ‘Silence, deep silence’. Shift of attention..., I don’t see any shift."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The idea of shifting one’s attention to a state of deep silence doesn’t seem apparent or tangible to me.  
**Explanation:** This statement reflects the confusion or skepticism that can arise when engaging with concepts such as ‘shift of attention.’ The process of shifting one's focus often feels insubstantial or elusive, prompting an introspective questioning of what it means to truly direct one’s attention towards silence or deeper states of being. Such a state of ‘deep silence’ is essential for understanding the nature of our consciousness and experience. It invites us to investigate the intricacies of how we perceive and interact with our environment and inner states. Recognizing this subtle shift prompts a broader inquiry into what it means to observe and understand our consciousness and our ‘I’ that witnesses this shift.  
**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness Practice:** Mindfulness involves bringing attention to the present moment, similar to the exploration of shifts in attention.  
- **Zen Buddhism:** The emphasis on ‘no mind’ or a state of pure awareness in Zen can relate closely to the silence mentioned here.  
- **Self-Inquiry:** The practice of trying to discern the ‘I’ that observes can relate to the teachings of Ramana Maharshi and other spiritual traditions focused on understanding the self.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which discusses the significance of being present and aware.  
- **What the Buddha Taught:** By Walpola Rahula, offering insights into Buddhist concepts of awareness and attention.  
- **I Am That:** By Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, where self-inquiry is explored extensively.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What does it mean to you to shift your attention to deeper states of silence and awareness, and how does this impact your sense of self?
