**Note 3: Contemplation of Higher Truths**  
**Title:** Spiritual Insight in Moments of Despair  
**Quote:** "For the first time in my life I was able to understand the meaning of the words, 'The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.'"  
**Translation into Modern English:** In a moment of deep despair, I truly understood what it means that angels exist in a constant state of awe and contemplation of the limitless divine.  
**Explanation:** The narrator’s moment of realization encapsulates the idea that profound truths can often emerge during periods of suffering. By connecting with the divine through contemplation of love, the narrator recognizes a transcendent reality that provides purpose and solace. This suggests that moments of despair can also lead to spiritual awakenings, unveiling deeper truths about existence and the divine.
