**Note 2: The Concept of Presence in Knowing**  
**Title:** The Role of Presence in the Experience of Knowing  
**Quote:** "So, what is here? There are no thoughts here, and this is what I see."  
**Translation into Modern English:** In this moment of reflection, I realize that in the absence of thoughts, I can still engage with the reality before me.  
**Explanation:** This excerpt presents an important insight into the contrast between thought and direct experience. The speaker reflects on a moment of pure presence where thoughts are absent, allowing for a different kind of knowing that transcends the limitations of mental constructs. In such moments, what remains is a pure engagement with reality, stripped of the filters that thoughts impose. This kind of knowing is significant because it allows for a more authentic connection to our experiences, one that can be transformative and enlightening. It implies that knowledge does not solely derive from conceptual understanding but also from experiential awareness. By nurturing this presence, individuals can deepen their connection to themselves and the world around them, paving the way for personal and spiritual growth.
