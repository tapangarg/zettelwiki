**Note 2: The Illusion of 'But...'**  
**Title:** The Trouble with "But" in Awareness  
**Quote:** "It is the ‘but, but, but...’ which is trouble. The sense of ‘but nothing happened’. What does it mean?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** The repetitive 'but' introduces doubt and creates unnecessary conflict in our perception. If nothing seems to happen, we question the validity of our awareness.  
**Explanation:** This note reflects on how the repetitive use of ‘but’ indicates a conflict within our perception of awareness. The author points out that often, our expectations of experience—typically tied to tangible, phenomenal occurrences—create a barrier to simply acknowledging awareness itself. When one claims, "but nothing happened," there’s an implication that awareness must yield a specific result or experience to be deemed valid. This pressure inhibits genuine recognition of the subtle aspects of awareness, thus creating inner turmoil. It serves as a reminder to approach awareness without preconceived notions of what it should provide, thereby fostering a more authentic relationship with one’s consciousness and promoting inner peace.  
**Connections:**  
- **Expectation vs. Reality:** The disparity between expected experiences of awareness and its inherent nature, akin to the principles discussed in cognitive behavioral therapy.  
- **The Paradox of Seeking:** The contradiction that arises when seeking experiences outside of the simple state of being, which is explored in many spiritual traditions.  
- **Attachment to Outcomes:** How attachment influences our experience and understanding, as discussed in Buddhist philosophy.  
**Further Reading:**

- **The Tao of Pooh** by Benjamin Hoff, illustrating simple wisdom through a humorous lens that can remind readers about the essence of being present.  
- **The Wisdom of No Escape and the Path of Loving Kindness** by Pema Chödrön, focusing on finding peace in the present moment despite the chaos of expectations.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can letting go of the need for specific outcomes in our awareness practices lead to a deeper understanding and acceptance of our conscious experience?
