**Note 1: The Nature of Knowingness**  
**Title:** The Immutable Quality of Awareness  
**Quote:** "It cannot come and go. [Silence] It cannot separate from I. Because I is That. I Am That."  
**Translation into Modern English:** This awareness does not fluctuate; it is not an object that can be lost or diminished. It is so fundamentally tied to the essence of 'I' that to recognize one is to acknowledge the other; I am this awareness itself.  
**Explanation:** In this passage, the author highlights a profound truth about the nature of consciousness or awareness. It posits that true knowingness is not something external, transient, or separate from our core self. Unlike memories or learned information, which can fade or evolve, this awareness is stagnant and ever-present. When we inquire into our essence, we find that our true identity is inseparable from this consciousness. This realization offers significant insights into personal growth, as it encourages us to shift our focus from transient thoughts and feelings towards the stable essence of our being. Recognizing this fundamental aspect of ourselves can lead to an enhanced understanding of existence and a deeper sense of peace.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Dualism:** The idea that self and awareness are one can be further explored through non-dual philosophies, which elucidate the relationship between the self and the universe.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques that anchor our attention in the present moment help cultivate an awareness that reflects this fundamental knowingness, allowing us to experience life more fully without attachment to thoughts or emotions.  
- **The Concept of Witnessing:** The practice of observing thoughts as separate from our identity aligns with the insights shared in this quote, emphasizing the distinction between awareness and fleeting mental states.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle:** A landmark work that discusses the nature of consciousness and living in the present moment.  
- **Being Aware of Being Aware by John O. Ditty:** This book explores the direct experience of awareness and how it shapes our understanding of self.  
- **I Am That by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj:** A collection of teachings that provides profound insights into the nature of self and consciousness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does the understanding that 'I Am That' change your perception of your thoughts and emotions, and what practices can you adopt to deepen your connection with this awareness?
