**Note 3: The Inquiry into Personal Essence**  
**Title:** Investigating the Meaning of ‘Me’  
**Quote:** "What do you mean by ‘me’?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** When you refer to yourself as ‘me,’ what is it that you are specifically identifying with?  

**Explanation:** This question drills down into the personal essence that individuals associate with their identity. The inquiry into what defines “me” encourages a profound reflection on the components that construct personal identity—ranging from thoughts, emotions, social roles, to physical appearances. In discussing the term ‘me,’ one is invited to peel away layers and consider whether one's identity is rooted in superficial attributes or if it finds deeper resonance in the essence of consciousness. This exploration is essential for personal development because it allows individuals to disentangle from societal labels and expectations, prompting a journey toward self-actualization and authenticity. The questioning encourages a re-examination of one’s identity narrative, leading to significant insights that can transform personal relationships and the overall approach to living.
