**Title:** The Crows: Messengers of Mortality

**Translation into Modern English:** The speaker reflects on the inevitability of death, as the crows represent decay and the consumption of the physical body.  
**Explanation:** The crows symbolize the inevitability of death and the dissolution of the physical form. Yet, the speakerâ€™s acknowledgment of this process does not equate to hopelessness; instead, it sets the stage for the exploration of spiritual existence beyond physical decay. The imagery serves as a reminder of mortality while simultaneously contrasting with the hope for a spiritual vision that transcends the bodily experience.
