**Note 1: The True Nature of Self-Identification**  
**Title:** Understanding the ‘I’ Beyond Surface-Level Identity  
**Quote:** "So, this ‘I’, the chameleon ‘I’ (which has been mis-identified with this floating, surface level ‘I’ of the person) now comes to the reality; which is the back-drop, the unchanging You."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The ‘I’ that we often identify with is often misleading and superficial. This identification resembles a chameleon, changing with circumstances and appearances. However, there exists a deeper ‘I’—the true self—which remains constant and serves as the foundation of our being.  
**Explanation:** In this text, Mooji points to the distinction between our superficial sense of self and our deeper, unchanging essence. The reference to the "chameleon ‘I’" highlights how our identities can change based on context, experiences, and perceptions. This false self is tied to external validation and fleeting emotions, leading to a continuous struggle with identity. The essence of who we truly are, however, is persistent and unyielding; it exists as the backdrop against which all experiences occur. Recognizing this allows one to detach from ephemeral thoughts and narratives, leading to a more profound sense of peace and stability in existence. This deeper understanding can foster greater emotional resilience, as one learns to observe life's happenings without becoming overly identified with them.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality:** This concept aligns closely with non-dual philosophies which teach that the true self is the observer rather than the observed.  
- **Buddhist Anatta (Non-Self):** The idea of no permanent self resonates with Buddhist teachings about the illusion of a static self amidst constant change.  
- **The Witness Consciousness:** Similar concepts in spiritual traditions discuss the 'witness self' which witnesses thought without attachment.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"Before I Am" by Mooji:** Explores the deeper realities of existence and the essence of the self.  
- **"I Am That" by Nisargadatta Maharaj:** A collection of dialogues elucidating the concept of non-duality and the nature of self.  
- **"The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle:** Discusses the importance of being present and recognizing the ego's misidentification with thoughts and experiences.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing the distinction between the changing surface self and the unchanging essence influence our daily interactions and emotional responses?
