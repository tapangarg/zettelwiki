**Note 2: The Essence of Sages and Everyday Existence**  
**Title:** Sages and the Universal Self  
**Quote:** "When weâ€™re not attracted to the gravitational pull of these thoughts, then your worldly expression also becomes that of a Sage."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When we learn not to be drawn in by the compelling nature of our thoughts, our behavior and existence reflect the qualities of a Sage.  

**Explanation:** Here, the speaker points to an intriguing insight about the nature of Sages, who are often viewed as enlightened beings possessing deep wisdom and understanding. The key to embodying this sage-like quality lies in our relationship with our thoughts. By recognizing and refusing to succumb to the gravitational pull of distracting thoughts, we can align our worldly expression with that of a Sage. This statement emphasizes that the essence of practicality and spiritual wisdom is not reserved for a select few but is accessible to all if they can navigate their mind with awareness. Our true identity, beyond the chaos of daily thoughts, reflects the qualities of wisdom and peace associated with spiritual sages.
