**Note 2: The Power of the Present Moment**  
**Title:** Embracing Right Now as a Path to Liberation  
**Quote:** "The simple way is to always start with Right Now and to see that the next thought that comes and goes."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The most straightforward approach to freeing oneself from conditioning is to focus on the present moment and observe thoughts as they arise and fade away.  
**Explanation:** The text emphasizes the importance of anchoring oneself in the present moment to break free from the chains of conditioning. By focusing on 'Right Now,' one begins to observe thoughts without attachment, allowing them to come and go rather than getting caught in the narrative created by them. This practice promotes awareness and detachment from the mental chatter that often defines the 'person' we think we are. It highlights that our sense of self can only exert influence over the present moment if we allow it, challenging the belief that the past or future have inherent power over our experience. This also nurtures a significant aspect of personal growth, as it fosters a deeper understanding of oneself uninfluenced by external narratives.  
**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness Meditation:** The practice of being present enhances awareness and leads to deeper self-understanding and tranquility.  
- **Non-Duality:** Many non-dual teachings emphasize the importance of present awareness and witnessing thought without identification.  
- **Flow State:** The psychological notion of 'flow' describes a state of complete immersion in the present, linked to greater productivity and satisfaction.
