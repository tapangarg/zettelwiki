**Note 2: The Challenge of Understanding Awareness**  
**Title:** The Difficulty in Comprehending Awareness  
**Quote:** "... the point is that there is not complete understanding of this Awareness so there is not complete understanding about this ‘I’ also, and therefore it is not that easy to answer your question."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The fundamental issue lies in the fact that without a complete understanding of Awareness, the comprehension of the 'I' is also lacking, making it challenging to answer the question transparently.  
**Explanation:** Here, the speaker acknowledges that awareness is a complex and often elusive concept. Our capacity to understand our own consciousness ('I') is inherently tied to our understanding of Awareness itself. This presents a philosophical paradox: if the 'I' is contingent upon Awareness, our grasp of who we are will always remain somewhat limited until we delve deeper into the nature of Awareness. Hence, the struggle to articulate feelings of self-awareness or identity stems from a lack of clarity surrounding these fundamental concepts. The implications are profound as it highlights the necessity of exploration and inquiry in pursuit of deeper self-knowledge, suggesting that the journey toward understanding is ongoing and may require humility and patience.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Limitations of Language:** Language often fails to encapsulate the depth of subjective experiences, which parallels the challenge in communicating insights about Awareness.  
- **Psychological Self-Awareness:** The relationship between self-awareness and mental health emphasizes that a deeper understanding of Awareness can lead to improved emotional well-being.  
- **Existentialism:** The exploration of existence and essence within existential philosophy raises similar inquiries regarding the self and the nature of awareness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Being and Time:** By Martin Heidegger, exploring the concept of Being and the nature of existence.  
- **The Varieties of Religious Experience:** By William James, which examines different states of awareness from a psychological and experiential standpoint.  
- **Anatomy of the Self:** By Carol Gilligan, which delves into identity and the complexity of self-awareness from a feminist psychological perspective.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How do our limitations in understanding Awareness affect our relationships, both with ourselves and with others?
