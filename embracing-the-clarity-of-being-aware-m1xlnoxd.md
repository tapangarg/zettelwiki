Note 3: The Clarity of Awareness  
**Title:** Embracing the Clarity of Being Aware  
**Quote:** "It is so clear that ‘I am aware’. Is it not clear?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** The awareness of our existence—the recognition that "I am aware"—is fundamentally evident, yet it invites deeper exploration.  

**Explanation:** This assertion emphasizes the inherent clarity of being aware. It underscores that our fundamental experience is not clouded by doubts or complexities; rather, it shines with simple clarity. The speaker's query about clarity serves as an invitation for self-reflection, prompting one to investigate the depth of this awareness without succumbing to distractions. The clarity of 'I am aware' serves as a cornerstone for spiritual growth and understanding, as it empowers individuals to shift their focus away from externalities and instead ground themselves in the fundamental experience of consciousness.
