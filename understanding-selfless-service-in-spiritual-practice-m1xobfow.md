**Note 2: The Essence of Seva**  
**Title:** Understanding Selfless Service in Spiritual Practice  
**Quote:** "Seva: Selfless service to Guru and God."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Seva refers to the act of serving others, particularly in the context of serving one's spiritual teacher (Guru) and the Divine, without attachment or desire for personal gain.  
**Explanation:** Seva, or selfless service, is a core principle in many spiritual traditions, promoting the idea of serving others as a sacred act that leads to spiritual growth. By engaging in selfless service to both a spiritual teacher and the Divine, practitioners cultivate humility, compassion, and the dissolution of the ego. This practice is significant because it shifts the focus from self-centered desires to a broader perspective of interconnectedness, ultimately fostering a sense of unity with others and the divine. Engaging in seva can be transformative, allowing practitioners to learn through service and find fulfillment not through receiving but through giving.
