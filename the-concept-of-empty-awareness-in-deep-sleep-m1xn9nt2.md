**Note 2: Defining the Experience of Deep Sleep**  
**Title:** The Concept of Empty Awareness in Deep Sleep  
**Quote:** "So, this which has no attribute..., you cannot even call it a Presence actually, it is before ‘I Am’."  
**Explanation:** Ananta expresses the idea that the state of consciousness in deep sleep is characterized by an absence of attributes or even presence, signaling it as a state existing before the identification with existence (“I Am”). This assertion challenges common perspectives that associate awareness solely with active, identifiable states. By emphasizing "empty awareness," we acknowledge that consciousness persists in a formless state—inherent and undeniable, yet profoundly different from conscious states defined by thought or sensation. This observation is significant for spiritual seekers, illuminating the concept that the core of our consciousness does not rely on our waking experiences. Such insights enrich an understanding of the self, suggesting a depth of awareness accessible even in non-interactive states.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Experience of Nothingness:** This relates to various philosophies that explore the experience of nothingness and its relevance to understanding consciousness.  
- **Meditative States:** Many meditative practices guide practitioners to recognize the quiet, formless state of awareness akin to deep sleep as an object of contemplation.  
- **Phenomenology of Consciousness:** The study of subjective experience highlights how awareness persists beyond identifiable phenomena.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Four Foundations of Mindfulness** by Bhikkhu Bodhi, discussing deep states of awareness through meditation.  
- **Being and Time** by Martin Heidegger, exploring existence and the nature of Being.  
- **No Self, No Problem** by Chris Niebauer, investigating the concept of self beyond experience and thought.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways might the recognition of 'empty awareness' during deep sleep shift your understanding of your identity and presence in waking life?
