**Note 3: Allowing vs. Stopping the Mind**  
**Title:** The Concept of Allowing vs. Stopping the Mind  
**Quote:** "I doubt very much that he said that ‘the mind completely stops’. I would like to see it."  
**Translation into Modern English:** I highly question the assertion that complete cessation of the mind is attainable or was even promised by the spiritual teacher. I would be curious to witness such a phenomenon.  
**Explanation:** This note stresses the importance of recognizing that complete stillness of the mind is neither practical nor often pursued in spiritual teachings. Instead, the process is about cultivating a relationship with thoughts—allowing them to arise and dissolve naturally without clinging or repulsion. The focus is redirected to acceptance, embodying a state of samadhi, rather than striving for an unattainable goal of a still mind. This understanding provides a more feasible pathway towards spiritual growth.  
**Connections:**  
- **Acceptance in Stoicism:** The Stoic philosophy underscores the importance of accepting what cannot be controlled, which parallels the acceptance of thought patterns and emotional responses.  
- **Socratic Method:** The tradition of engaging with one’s thoughts and contradictions in the search for truth aligns with the practice of allowing thoughts to come and go without dismissal.  
- **Contemplative Prayer in Mysticism:** Various mystical traditions emphasize a posture of receptivity rather than an active suppression of thoughts during contemplative practice.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Art of Happiness** by the Dalai Lama, exploring concepts of acceptance and the mind’s nature.  
- **A Path with Heart** by Jack Kornfield, which discusses nurturing the mind in meditation and daily life.  
- **The Miracle of Mindfulness** by Thich Nhat Hanh, focusing on living fully with thoughts and emotions.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What does allowing thoughts rather than attempting to stop them reveal about the nature of your consciousness?
