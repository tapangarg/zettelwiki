**Note 3: Attachment to the Small 'a' of Appearance**  
**Title:** The Trouble of Identifying with Appearances  
**Quote:** "If you’re identifying with the small ‘a’ of appearance, then trouble."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Identifying ourselves primarily with temporary phenomena leads to inevitable difficulties and challenges in life.  
**Explanation:** The identification with the transient appearances of life, such as emotions, thoughts, and external circumstances, can lead to a sense of distress or turmoil. This idea echoes the teachings of many spiritual traditions that believe attachment to appearances clouds our true nature and can cultivate a sense of discontent. When we find our identity tied up in our roles, achievements, or even the judgments we hold about ourselves or others, it creates a fragile foundation for our sense of self—it is vulnerable to change and ultimately produces suffering. Recognizing this allows one to shift focus from the external to the internal, aligning with the deeper essence of Awareness, which is unconditioned, stable, and enduring.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Nature of Ego:** The ego thrives on attachment to appearances, and understanding this can help in diminishing its grip.  
- **Spiritual Bypassing:** A tendency to dismiss or avoid unpleasant aspects of reality, leading to more profound challenges. Recognizing this can pave the way for deeper work on the self.  
- **Mindful Living:** Being present and aware of our thoughts and feelings without attachment fosters a healthier relationship with appearances.

- **"Radical Acceptance" by Tara Brach:** Explores how acceptance can liberate individuals from suffering attached to appearances.  
- **"The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle:** Offers insights on transcending identification with thoughts and appearances to enter deeper states of awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing the fleeting nature of your thoughts and experiences affect your interactions and sense of self?
