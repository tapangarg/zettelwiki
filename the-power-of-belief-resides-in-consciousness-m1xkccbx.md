**Note 1: The Nature of Consciousness and Belief**  
**Title:** The Power of Belief Resides in Consciousness  
**Quote:** "only Consciousness is here therefore only Consciousness can do it. That's why I say that the powers of attention and belief only belong to Consciousness."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Only Consciousness exists, and as such, only Consciousness has the ability to believe. The powers of focusing attention and forming beliefs are attributes solely of Consciousness itself.  
**Explanation:** This passage asserts a fundamental perspective on the fabric of existence, suggesting that Consciousness is not just a backdrop but the very essence that engages with thoughts and beliefs. Unlike thoughts, which are transient and fleeting, Consciousness possesses the inherent weight of belief. The statement that belief does not originate from thoughts, which come and go, emphasizes the stability of Consciousness as the source of meaning and engagement with reality. This notion challenges the conventional understanding of the self as a separate entity capable of independent thought and belief, suggesting instead that the essence of *who we are* is intricately tied to the universal aspect of Consciousness, reinforcing the notion of interconnectedness in our experiences.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Dualism:** This idea aligns with non-dual philosophies that view the self and the universe as manifestations of the same Consciousness.  
- **Buddhist Concept of Anatta (Non-Self):** Reflects the idea that there is no permanent self, and thus the self we attribute belief to is also an illusion.  
- **Psychology of Belief:** Explores how beliefs form and the transient nature of thoughts, echoing themes found in cognitive behavioral therapy.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"I Am That" by Nisargadatta Maharaj:** A spiritual classic that discusses the nature of self and reality from a non-dual perspective.  
- **"The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle:** Discusses consciousness, presence, and the nature of thoughts and ego.  
- **"The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching" by Thich Nhat Hanh:** Provides insights into Buddhist philosophy regarding the nature of self and attachment to beliefs.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How might the realization that belief arises from Consciousness rather than individual thoughts transform your approach to mental challenges and identity?
