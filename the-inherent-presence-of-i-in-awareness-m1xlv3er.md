**Note 1: The Unfindability of 'I'**  
**Title:** The Inherent Presence of 'I' in Awareness  
**Quote:** "You cannot find the ‘I’ is exactly what I’m saying. You cannot find it phenomenally; that’s why it is confusing to the mind."  
**Translation into Modern English:** You cannot locate the 'I' in a tangible way; this leads to confusion for the mind.  
**Explanation:** The text delves into the complex relationship between the self ('I') and awareness. It presents the argument that while individuals may search for their sense of self, they inevitably encounter challenges in defining the 'I' because it exists beyond phenomenal (sensory or observable) understanding. The paradox is that the 'I' is intrinsically linked to the awareness one experiences — one can say "I am aware" without needing to delineate the 'I' first. This teaches us that the essence of 'I' may not reside in a definable entity we can perceive, but rather in the state of awareness itself. Recognizing this can lead to a deeper understanding of one's identity and existence.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-duality:** Concepts from non-dual philosophies that emphasize the oneness of consciousness and the self.  
- **Zen Buddhism:** The emphasis on 'no-self' (anatta) and the idea that clinging to the self is a source of suffering.  
- **Advaita Vedanta:** The philosophical view that enlightened understanding reveals the false duality between individuality and universal consciousness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That:** By Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, presents teachings on awareness and the nature of self.  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which encourages living in the present moment and understanding the self in relation to consciousness.  
- **Be As You Are: Teachings from Ramana Maharshi:** Offers insights into self-inquiry and realization of true self-awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does the realization that 'I' cannot be found phenomenally affect your understanding of existence and your relationship with self-awareness?
