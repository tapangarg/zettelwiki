**Note 1: The Nature of Thought and Contemplation**  
**Title:** Recognizing the Unbuoyed Mind  
**Quote:** "We’ve gotten a little used to not buying the thoughts which are coming, you see. Otherwise the minute we get into the contemplation, the mind wants to attack and confuse and distract and contradict."  
**Translation into Modern English:** We have become accustomed to not accepting the thoughts that arise in our minds. However, as soon as we start engaging in contemplation, our minds tend to bombard us with distractions, confusion, and conflicting ideas.  
**Explanation:** The author emphasizes the challenge of maintaining a focused contemplation practice amidst the chaos of mental chatter. It highlights how thoughts can be intrusive, often leading to a disjointed experience of meditation or reflection. Becoming aware of these thought patterns is crucial to not allowing them to dictate our states of mind. This awareness can pave the way for deeper contemplation and an enhanced ability to center oneself in stillness, rather than becoming overwhelmed by distractions.  
**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness and Thought Observation:** This concept connects to mindfulness practices, which teach individuals to observe thoughts without attachment.  
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT techniques often address cognitive distortions and aim to reframe intrusive thoughts, echoing the idea of recognizing and not buying into negative mental patterns.  
- **Meditative Practices in Various Traditions:** Many spiritual practices include methods to quiet the mind and sit with thoughts without judgment, creating space for deeper insight.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Miracle of Mindfulness:** By Thich Nhat Hanh, which offers insights into mindfulness practice and thoughts’ nature.  
- **Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion:** By Sam Harris, discussing the nature of consciousness and thought.  
- **The Mind Illuminated:** By Culadasa (John Yates), which provides a detailed framework for meditation and dealing with distractions.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can one cultivate a steady practice of contemplation while managing the inevitable distractions of the mind?
