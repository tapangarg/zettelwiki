**Note 3: The Challenge of Distraction in Prayer**  
**Title:** Overcoming Distractions in Devotion  
**Quote:** "So now suppose.. The beginner is comfortable with mental praying. Next? With mental chanting our Anthakarna may become fully empty yes?"

**Explanation:** This statement recognizes the challenges beginners face when trying to maintain focus during prayer. Mental chanting can serve as a bridge to quieter moments of pure presence.
