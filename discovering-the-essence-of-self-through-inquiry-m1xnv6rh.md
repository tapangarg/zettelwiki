**Note 1: The Quest for the 'I'**  
**Title:** Discovering the Essence of Self Through Inquiry  
**Quote:** "if all of this fails and we feel like... ...stick to this question 'Who is the ‘I’ that cannot find even I Am?'"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Even in times of confusion or doubt about our existence or identity, focusing on the question of 'Who is the 'I' that is unable to recognize 'I Am'?' is critical.  
**Explanation:** This passage emphasizes the profound importance of self-inquiry as a tool for spiritual discovery. The question of 'Who am I?' acts as a focal point for the seeker, steering the mind away from external distractions and towards introspection. It suggests that engaging with our sense of self, particularly in the context of feeling lost or disconnected, can catalyze deeper realizations about the true nature of our being. By recognizing the inherent struggle to understand our core self, we uncover layers of consciousness that are often obscured by our personal narratives and experiences. This inquiry transcends mere intellectual understanding, inviting us to explore the depths of our existence and cultivate awareness.
