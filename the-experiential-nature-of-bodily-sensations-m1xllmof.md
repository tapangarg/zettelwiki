**Note 2: Sensations in the Body and Their Perception**  
**Title:** The Experiential Nature of Bodily Sensations  
**Quote:** “Now let’s notice how all the sensations in the body are also different forms of energy being perceived.”  
**Translation into Modern English:** Let's recognize that bodily sensations are energy experiences that we are perceiving just as we perceive thoughts.  
**Explanation:** This passage extends the idea of perception beyond thoughts to include bodily sensations. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of mind and body, suggesting that sensations can be observed similarly to thoughts—energy that flows through and informs our experience. The act of paying attention to these sensations brings them to life, enhancing our awareness of the body's role in our overall perception of reality. This concept is significant as it points to a holistic understanding of human experience where both the mind and body create a continuous feedback loop of awareness, vital for growth, healing, and self-knowledge.  
**Connections:**
