**Note 4: The Inquiry into Existence in Absence of Forms**  
**Title:** The Essence of Being Without Words or Feelings  
**Quote:** "If there were no feelings also... what would still remain?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** If we strip away all sensations and language, what is the essence that persists?  
**Explanation:** This profound inquiry challenges individuals to consider the baseline of their existence that operates independently of form, sensation, or thought. The suggestion that something remains even in the absence of everything else prompts an exploration of pure existence. In grappling with this idea, individuals may uncover layers of understanding that extend far beyond identification with their thoughts and feelings, inviting a transcendent experience of being. This concept is crucial for spiritual seekers, as it leads to the discovery of a deep sense of peace and acceptance that isn't contingent on external or internal experiences.
