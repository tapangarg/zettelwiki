**Note 1: The Importance of Choice in Spiritual Life**  
**Title:** The Centrality of Choosing in Human Existence  
**Quote:** "The whole Bible is one long sermon on the word Choose. ‘I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life’ (Deut. 30:19)."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The essence of the Bible can be understood as emphasizing the concept of choice. It presents us with the fundamental decision to choose between life and death, and to opt for the blessings that come from our choices.  
**Explanation:** The idea of choice is presented as a fundamental aspect of our spiritual lives. Each day, we are confronted with decisions that reflect our values and beliefs. St. Thérèse highlights that our lives consist of these choices, which shape our identity and relationships, particularly in the context of love and our response to God. The significance lies in realizing that every choice we make contributes to our growth and personal spiritual journey.  
**Connections:**  
- **Free Will and Moral Responsibility:** The concept of free will is vital in many religious and philosophical discourses, emphasizing that our choices define us.  
- **Covenant Theology:** The notion that humanity is in a relationship with God that involves choices, echoing the calls to choose God’s path as seen in biblical traditions.  
- **Decision-Making in Mystical Traditions:** Various mystical movements emphasize the importance of inner choices and discernment in pursuing spiritual growth and connection with the Divine.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Freedom of a Christian** by Martin Luther, which explores the concept of freedom in relation to choice and faith.  
- **The Hardest Peace: Expecting Grace in the Midst of Life's Hard** by Kara Tippets, focusing on how choices shape our life experiences amidst difficulties.  
- **The Choice: Embrace the Unknown** by Dr. Mike D. Smith, discussing personal choice as a primary driver of human experience and spiritual evolution.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How do the choices you make every day reflect your deepest values and relationship with the divine, and how can you become more intentional in your decision-making process?
