**Note 2: Divine Love Amidst Darkness**  
**Title:** God’s Love Shines in Our Darkest Moments  
**Quote:** “God’s light would periodically ‘shine through even in the midst of the darkest storm . . . [and for a brief moment] heaven was calm and serene and I believed I felt there was a heaven and that this heaven is peopled with souls who actually love me, who consider me their child’” (S 297–99).  

**Translation into Modern English:** Even during the darkest times, moments arise where God’s love breaks through, allowing me to feel serenity and a sense of Heaven filled with loving souls who cherish me.  

**Explanation:** Thérèse illustrates the comforting presence of divine love that cuts through suffering, providing revitalization and hope. These fleeting moments serve as reminders of an eternal love that exists beyond our current struggles, suggesting that even in despair, one can access a deeper connection to the Divine.  

**Connections:**  
- **The Presence of Grace:** This experience echoes the concept of grace in various spiritual traditions, where moments of divine intervention occur amidst hardship.  
- **Mystical Experiences:** The momentary glimpses of love echo the descriptions found in various mystical literature where individuals encounter profound moments of divine connection.  
- **Mindfulness in Suffering:** The ability to observe moments of light amidst despair parallels modern practices of mindfulness that emphasize presence amidst challenges.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **The Interior Castle** by St. Teresa of Avila, focusing on the journey of the soul towards divine union, often through suffering.  
- **The Joy of Living** by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, emphasizing the light that can be found during times of darkness through mindfulness.  
- **A Grief Observed** by C.S. Lewis, reflecting on the profound encounters with divine love amidst personal loss and anguish.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How can moments of divine love during dark times reshape your understanding of suffering and spirituality?
