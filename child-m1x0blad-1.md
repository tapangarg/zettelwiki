**Note 1: The Majesty of a City at Dawn**
**Title:** The Sublime Beauty of the City Draped in Morning Light  
**Quote:** "This city now doth like a garment wear the beauty of the morning; silent, bare..."  
**Explanation:** The author marvels at the sight of a city enveloped in the serene and profound beauty of dawn. This imagery portrays the city as transforming beneath the tranquil glow of morning, casting aside its usual hustle and bustle. This moment of stillness allows the viewer to perceive the city in its purest form, much like an untouched canvas adorned by the natural world. Such reflections on cities at dawn can offer profound inspiration for contemplative thought and awareness.
