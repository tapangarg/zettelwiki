**Note 2: The Nature of the ‘I’ in Awareness**  
**Title:** Inquiry into the Nature of Self  
**Quote:** "The One that Sees it. What do we See about that One?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** The fundamental act of seeing leads us to question the essence of the 'I' that perceives this awareness.  
**Explanation:** This concept invites deep introspection into the identity of the perceiver. By inquiring "What do we See about that One?" we are prompted to explore the very essence of our identity. The speaker suggests that as we look deeper into the 'I', we may encounter a sense of void or emptiness. This void is not to be feared; rather, it is indicative of the unconditioned and limitless nature of awareness itself. Thus, recognizing this void can become a catalyst for spiritual awakening, freeing individuals from attachments to identities that are superficial or transient.  
**Connections:**  
- **Buddhist Concept of Anatta (Non-Self):** This inquiry aligns with the Buddhist teaching that the self is an illusion, a teaching that encourages seeing through the false sense of identity.  
- **Existential Philosophy:** Existential thought frequently confronts questions of self and existence, providing a philosophical backdrop to these inquiries into awareness.  
- **Zen Koans:** The thought-provoking questions posed in Zen practice echo this inquiry by challenging the nature of reality and perception.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Being Nobody, Going Nowhere: Confessions of a Secret Buddhist by Ajahn Chah**, which discusses the nature of self in Buddhism.  
- **The Three Pillars of Zen by Philip Kapleau**, which introduces the teachings and practices that lead to understanding non-duality.  
- **The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself by Michael A. Singer**, which advocates for exploring consciousness beyond the confines of ego.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways does investigating the nature of the 'I' change your perceptual landscape, and how does this shift your daily existence?
