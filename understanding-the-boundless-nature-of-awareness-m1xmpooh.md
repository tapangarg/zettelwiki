Note 1: The Nature of Self and Awareness  
**Title:** Understanding the Boundless Nature of Awareness  
**Quote:** "But this ‘you’ immediately that is bought is not Awareness anymore."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The moment we construct an identity from our experiences, we are no longer connected to our true Awareness.  
**Explanation:** This passage dives into the complex relationship between self-identity (the 'I') and the notion of Awareness. In moments of quiet contemplation or meditation, one might experience a sense of unity with Awareness, realizing that they are not merely a collection of thoughts or experiences. However, this realization is often fleeting, as the mind quickly reverts to its construct of self, suggesting that the awareness of that moment was merely an experience for a separate 'self.' This underscores the significance of recognizing the illusion of the separate self and realizing one's fundamental nature as Awareness itself. This understanding is crucial for personal growth and spiritual evolution, as it opens the door to a deeper exploration of consciousness beyond superficial identifications.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality:** The philosophical perspective that there is no separation between self and the universe, emphasizing the oneness of Awareness.  
- **Zen Buddhism:** Many teachings in Zen emphasize the practice of seeing beyond one’s constructed identity to realize intrinsic, unconditioned Awareness.  
- **Ego vs. True Self:** Understanding the distinction between the constructed ego (the ‘I’) and the true essence of one’s being can facilitate a profound inner transformation.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, which explores the nature of self and awareness in a non-dual context.  
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment** by Eckhart Tolle, focusing on living in the present and recognizing one's essence as Awareness.  
- **The Heart of Understanding: Commentaries on the Heart Sutra** by Thich Nhat Hanh, offering insights into mindfulness and the concept of no-self.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can the practice of questioning ‘Who is aware of this Awareness?’ help you dissolve limiting beliefs and deepen your understanding of your true nature?
