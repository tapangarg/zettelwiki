**Note 1: The Illusion of Time in Self-Inquiry**  
**Title:** The Timeless Nature of Self-Awareness  
**Quote:** "What is important is to be able to just See what is here now. And the mind will come and say ‘But..., [you-as-a-person] is Seeing this’. But this is pure fiction."  
**Translation into Modern English:** What truly matters is to be present and aware of the current moment. The mind may try to assert that it is the individual experiencing this awareness, but this notion is a fabrication.  
**Explanation:** This idea challenges the common belief that one can be behind in their spiritual journey or understanding. The speaker emphasizes the immediacy of awareness — that the present moment is where truth lies. The anxiety around ‘taking too long’ reflects a misunderstanding of the nature of consciousness; in reality, the essence of awareness is immediate and does not conform to temporal limitations. Notably, this notion suggests that the individual's identity (ego) is an illusion and distracts from realizing the pure state of awareness that exists beyond personal narratives. This realization can lead to profound liberation as one recognizes that the observer (the 'I') is not separate from the act of observing.  
**Connections:**  
- **Awareness and Presence:** The practice of mindfulness promotes being in the present moment, which parallels the idea of simply ‘Seeing what is here now.’  
- **Non-Dual Awareness:** Philosophical frameworks that discuss the unity of observer and observed resonate with this exploration, hinting that separation is a constructed idea.  
- **Ego Dissolution:** The process of recognizing the illusory nature of the ‘I’ connects to many teachings focused on transcending personal identity.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment by Eckhart Tolle**, which discusses the importance of present-awareness as a path to awakening.  
- **I Am That by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj**, which addresses questions of identity and the nature of awareness from a non-dual perspective.  
- **Awakening to Reality: A Guide to Understanding Non-Duality** by Greg Goode, which examines the nature of consciousness and self-awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does challenging the narrative of being 'unworthy' or 'taking too long' alter your relationship with personal growth and present awareness?
