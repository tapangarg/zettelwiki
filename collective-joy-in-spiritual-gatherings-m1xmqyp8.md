**Note 3: The Role of Satsang in Experiencing Collective Joy**  
**Title:** Collective Joy in Spiritual Gatherings  
**Quote:** "It is only in Satsang that I have found this kind of spontaneous laughter, with no seeming cause."  
**Translation into Modern English:** I have discovered that only in the setting of satsang do I experience spontaneous laughter that arises effortlessly without any specific reason.  

**Explanation:** The experience of spontaneous laughter in the context of satsang points to the unique power of spiritual community. In gatherings that focus on inquiry and shared exploration, individual walls of self-consciousness often dissolve, allowing for genuine expressions of joy and connection. This laughter is emblematic of a collective awakening to the present moment, where participants are free to experience joy as it arises, rather than as a negotiated or sought-after experience. The significance of this phenomenon is profound, highlighting how community can foster a deep sense of belonging and shared joy, prompting individuals to release their inhibitions and fully embrace the present.
