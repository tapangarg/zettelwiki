**Note 1: The Nature of Doership and Its Implications**  
**Title:** The Illusion of Control: Pride, Guilt, and Doership  
**Quote:** "So, both pride and guilt are based on this sense of doership."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Both feelings of pride and guilt arise from the belief that we are personally responsible for our actions and their outcomes.  
**Explanation:** The notion of doership implies that individuals have control over their actions and the results that follow. When we experience pride, it stems from the belief that our actions led to a successful outcome. Conversely, guilt arises when we believe our actions failed or caused harm. This duality sustains a cycle of self-judgment, where we attribute the weight of our experiences solely to our individual control. Understanding the roots of pride and guilt helps one transcend these feelings by recognizing that much is beyond our control and is part of a greater existence or universal flow. This realization can foster a sense of humility and interconnectedness, inviting a more compassionate relationship with oneself and others.  
**Connections:**  
- **Buddhist Philosophy:** The concept of non-attachment and the recognition that self is an illusion can lead to reduced guilt and pride.  
- **Existential Psychology:** Understanding the limits of personal control can facilitate deeper self-acceptance and richer interpersonal connections.  
- **Surrender in Spiritual Traditions:** The practice of surrendering to a higher power, such as the Divine or a spiritual guide, diminishes the burden of doership.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which emphasizes presence over self-judging thoughts and the illusion of control.  
- **Being Nobody, Going Nowhere:** By Ayya Khema, which explores the Buddhist perspective on self and surrender.  
- **Letting Go: The Pathway of Surrender:** By David R. Hawkins, which offers insights into the profound release of personal doership.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can recognizing the limits of my control reshape my emotional experiences of pride and guilt in daily life?
