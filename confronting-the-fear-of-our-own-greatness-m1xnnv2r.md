**Note 2: The Fear of Magnificence and Emptiness**  
**Title:** Confronting the Fear of Our Own Greatness  
**Quote:** "Actually, many of you are scared of this. Many of you are just scared of how great you are, how large you are, how timeless you are."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Many individuals feel fear when faced with the vastness of their own potential, their true nature, and the timeless aspect of their being.  
**Explanation:** The passage draws attention to a paradoxical fear that many individuals experience: the fear of recognizing their own greatness and infinite potential. In recognizing oneself as large, timeless, and magnificent, one may also confront a deep-seated fear of emptiness or nothingness. This fear can stem from the realization that, at the core of our existence, we may not find the individual "self" that society and culture often exalt. Therefore, the recognition of our own vastness can lead to existential anxiety, as we grapple with the concept of self that is both grand and fundamentally empty. This understanding can catalyze personal growth, challenging individuals to explore what it means to exist beyond the ego and to embrace profound potential.
