**Note 3: The Unstoppable Nature of Being**  
**Title:** The Eternal Nature of Existence  
**Quote:** "Can you stop being now? ...this Presence of Being is here. It cannot be stopped."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The question posed is whether one can cease their existence at this moment, revealing that the essence of being is always present and can’t be turned off.  
**Explanation:** This emphasizes a crucial understanding that the essence of our existence—‘Being’—is inescapable. It suggests that amidst our struggles and thoughts, there lies an undeniable presence that is constant and unchanging. This presence transcends the turmoil of daily life and the complexities of thought; it is the foundation upon which we exist. Recognizing the unyielding nature of being can invoke profound peace and stability, grounding us in moments of turmoil. This idea invites contemplation of what it truly means to 'be' beyond our individual experiences and how that presence is a shared human experience, fostering connection.

- **Non-duality in Advaita Vedanta:** Suggests that behind all experiences lies a singular, unchanging essence.
