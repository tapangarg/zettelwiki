**Note 1: The Effort of Effortlessness**  
**Title:** The Paradox of Reaching Effortlessness  
**Quote:** "Because, if coming to effortlessness feels like effort...., then we must make that effort."  
**Translation into Modern English:** If achieving a state of effortlessness seems to require a lot of effort, then it is crucial that we put in that effort.  
**Explanation:** This statement highlights a profound paradox in spiritual and contemplative practices: often, the path to achieving a state of ease and flow is marked by significant mental or emotional exertion. The inquiry into awareness may initially seem daunting or tiring; however, the process of probing our existence requires us to intentionally engage in these efforts. By recognizing that effort can lead to a state of letting go, we find ourselves on a transformative path where the act of striving is paradoxically essential to arriving at a place of effortless being. The significance lies in acknowledging that spiritual progress often manifests through hardship or the labor of mental stamina, leading ultimately to liberation from the very constructs that bind us.  
**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness Practice:** The effort required in mindfulness can lead to a sense of deeper insight and presence once the initial struggle is overcome.  
- **The Tao of Effortless Action (Wu Wei):** In Taoism, "wu wei" emphasizes achieving goals with minimum effort, yet it acknowledges that initial discipline may be necessary to reach that state.  
- **Spiritual Inquiry:** The practice of self-inquiry in various traditions requires an initial commitment that can feel strenuous but ultimately leads to greater clarity and understanding of the self and reality.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Miracle of Mindfulness:** By Thich Nhat Hanh, which discusses mindfulness as a practice that often begins with effort but can lead to natural ease.  
- **The Tao Te Ching:** By Lao Tzu, especially passages that discuss effortlessness in action.  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which dives into awareness and living fully in the present moment.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What might your daily practice look like if you embraced the initial effort as a necessary step toward experiencing deeper states of ease and consciousness?
