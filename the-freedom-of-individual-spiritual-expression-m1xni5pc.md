**Note 3: No Fixed Template for Freedom**  
**Title:** The Freedom of Individual Spiritual Expression  
**Quote:** "There is no set template for freedom. It is only a response to your inner urge of coming home."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Freedom does not have a specific formula; it arises naturally from one’s innate longing to return to one’s true self.  
**Explanation:** The author argues that spiritual freedom is a unique and personal experience, not bound by strict guidelines or templates. Each individual's journey is influenced by their unique circumstances, desires, and experiences. This idea encourages an exploration of personal authenticity and emphasizes that the quest for freedom is deeply personal and can vary widely from person to person. It suggests that the essence of spiritual exploration should consider personal inclinations—be it inquiry, devotion, or other practices—without feeling confined to a prescribed notion of what it means to be spiritually free.  
**Connections:**

- **The Role of Intuition in Spiritual Growth:** Trusting one's internal guidance as a compass on the spiritual journey.
