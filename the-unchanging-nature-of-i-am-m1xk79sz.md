**Note 2: The Essence of I Am Beyond Attributes**  
**Title:** The Unchanging Nature of I Am  
**Quote:** "Unchanging, unmoving, unconcerned, with no attributes, no labels."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The essence of existence, articulated as 'I Am,' is constant and devoid of any specific characteristics or identities.  
**Explanation:** The claim that the 'I Am' is unchanging and without attributes points to a fundamental quality of existence itself—its innate stability regardless of the changes surrounding it. This suggests that the true essence of who we are is not defined by external circumstances, emotions, or transient states. By recognizing this essence, individuals can cultivate an experience of peace and contentment, free from the turmoil that arises when we identify too strongly with our fleeting thoughts and feelings. The significance lies in the liberation it provides, allowing one to move beyond conditioned identities and recognize the deeper self that simply 'is.'  
**Connections:**  
- **Stoicism:** The understanding of an unshakeable inner foundation amidst external chaos.  
- **Hinduism’s Eternal Atman:** The belief in an eternal soul that transcends physical manifestation.  
- **Existentialism:** The recognition and confrontation of an identity beyond the roles and labels we wear.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now** by Eckhart Tolle focuses on the present moment and the essence of 'being.'  
- **The Untethered Soul** by Michael A. Singer, which examines inner peace and self-identity.  
- **Be Here Now** by Ram Dass, which provides insights into mindfulness and presence.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What practices can facilitate direct contact with the unchangeable aspect of your being, beyond labels and definitions?
