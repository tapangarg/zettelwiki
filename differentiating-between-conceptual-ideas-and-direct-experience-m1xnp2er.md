**Note 2: Distinction Between Concept and Experience**  
**Title:** Differentiating Between Conceptual Ideas and Direct Experience  
**Quote:** "We are not making it up conceptually; it is not an idea."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Our awareness and existence shouldn't be thought of merely as concepts; they reflect a fundamental reality rather than theoretical notions.  

**Explanation:** The speaker draws an important distinction between abstract ideas and lived experience. While various beliefs about existence—such as the idea of a deity—can be beautiful abstractions, they remain separate from the direct experience of one's own existence that the phrase 'I Am' articulates. This differentiation has significant implications for both philosophical inquiry and spiritual practice, encouraging a more intimate connection with one's inner life and awareness. By recognizing that our awareness of 'I Am' stems from lived experience, we can shift our approach from intellectualizing existence to embodying and understanding our own consciousness. This pivot can deepen our spiritual and personal understanding.

**Connections:**  
- **Philosophy of Mind:** The study of consciousness and self-awareness in philosophy, notably by figures like Daniel Dennett.  
- **Theology vs. Mysticism:** The interplay between dogma and personal experience in spiritual traditions, highlighting the contrast between conceptual belief and direct experience.  
- **Direct Experience in Mystical Traditions:** Various traditions that emphasize personal direct experiences of divinity or truth, such as Sufism or Zen Buddhism.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **Consciousness Explained** by Daniel Dennett, offering insights into the complexities of consciousness.  
- **The Seven Storey Mountain** by Thomas Merton, which explores spiritual journey through personal experience.  
- **Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind** by Shunryu Suzuki, which emphasizes experiencing the present moment beyond conceptualization.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How might recognizing the difference between concepts and direct experiences impact your approach to understanding reality?
