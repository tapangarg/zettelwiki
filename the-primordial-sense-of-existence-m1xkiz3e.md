**Note 2: The Concept of Existence**  
**Title:** The Primordial Sense of Existence  
**Quote:** "The sense that ‘I exist’ is primal to this existence, even a child says ‘I woke up and I went to sleep’."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The awareness of one’s own existence is fundamental; even a child recognizes the states of waking and sleeping.  

**Explanation:** This note discusses the fundamental nature of existence, characterized by a primal awareness that precedes conscious thought. The phrase "I exist" serves as a foundational element of human experience, evident even in young children who express their being through the simple acknowledgment of daily activities. This acknowledgment signifies the deepest essence of consciousness, which transcends ideation. The significance lies in understanding that this awareness of existence is inherent and does not require abstract thinking. It highlights the importance of returning to this pure sense of being to find clarity and wisdom that transcends the noise of ideological thought.  

**Connections:**  
- **Phenomenology:** The philosophical study that focuses on structures of experience and consciousness, emphasizing direct perception of existence.  
- **Child Development Psychology:** Research showing that awareness of self and environment is intrinsic in early childhood development.  
- **Non-Dualism:** Many spiritual traditions advocate for recognizing the essential oneness of existence beyond identities and concepts.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **Being and Time** by Martin Heidegger, which explores the experience of being and existence.  
- **The Tao Te Ching** by Laozi, which presents a view of existence aligned with natural flow and being.  
- **The Miracle of Mindfulness** by Thich Nhat Hanh, which discusses the essence of being present and aware of existence.  

**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can cultivating a deeper awareness of our existence enhance our daily lives and affect our relationships with others?
