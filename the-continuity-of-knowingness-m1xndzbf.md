**Note 2: The Ever-Present Knowingness**  
**Title:** The Continuity of Knowingness  
**Quote:** "Knowingness is always Knowing Itself. Thereâ€™s been no break in that."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Knowingness is in a constant state of awareness of itself; it has never been interrupted.  
**Explanation:** This profound assertion challenges our typical understanding of knowledge and self-awareness. Knowingness, defined here as the innate awareness that all conscious beings possess, never ceases to recognize its essence. This continuity suggests that our sense of self and understanding is not merely a product of experiences but rather a fundamental trait of our consciousness. The implication of this idea is profound; it reframes our perceptions of personal growth and fulfillment, recognizing that peace and contentment arise not from external validation or experiences but from a recognition of this ongoing self-knowing.  
**Connections:**  
- **Ego and Identity:** Understanding Knowingness can lead to an exploration of the ego, revealing how much of our conflict arises from misunderstanding this relationship.  
- **Non-Dual Philosophy:** Many non-dual teachings argue that true self-realization lies in recognizing the unity of consciousness and knowing.   
- **Awakening Experiences:** Instances where individuals have a sudden awakening often highlight an intrinsic understanding of this knowingness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That:** By Nisargadatta Maharaj - A collection of dialogues on self-inquiry and understanding of consciousness.  
- **The Science of Being Great:** By Wallace D. Wattles - Discusses personal development through understanding consciousness and knowing.  
- **The Heart of Awareness:** By Tich Nhat Hanh - Explores awareness in daily life and its connection to inner peace.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can recognizing this unbroken Knowingness influence the way we approach learning, growth, and personal development?
