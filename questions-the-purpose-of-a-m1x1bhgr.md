Questions. The purpose of a bridge is to convey us from one place to another. Stopping upon a bridge is symbolic of a contemplative stance toward life; it is choosing to pause and to drink in the beauty of the moment. Several years ago I saw an exhibition of paintings by Monet. I was struck by the fact that the subject matter of many of his paintings was of train stations, factories, and constructions sites. One painting entitled The Train, which showed a train in the foreground and numerous factories belching out clouds of black smoke in the background, occasioned one author to comment, “The site in this picture looks more like Gary, Indiana than anything traditionally associated with Impressionistic France.”12 How strange that people would take time to come to a museum and stand in front of a painting depicting such a commonplace sight! But is not this one example of what art invites us to do, to pause and look at what we see every day, but never take the time to contemplate? What are the “Westminster bridges” of your daily round that contain the “morning dew” of God’s beauty? Have you become blasé to them because you have not taken time to pause and look?
