**Note 2: The Nature of Inquiry**  
**Title:** Questioning the Nature of Identity  
**Quote:** "So, if you did the inquiry, then you must answer the question ‘Who did the inquiry?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** If you engaged in this inquiry, it is essential to reflect on the identity of the inquirer: Who is it that is questioning?  
**Explanation:** This reflects a deeper recognition of the self and the often mistaken notion of an autonomous 'I' that conducts inquiries. The practice of inquiry is to peel back layers of self, challenging the conventional understanding of identity. The central question—"Who is inquiring?"—urges practitioners to scrutinize the very nature of self and consciousness. The idea suggests that what we identify as 'the self' is often an illusion, crafted by thought and perception. Recognizing this can lead to profound insights into the nature of reality and self, prompting a transcendent view that ultimately leads to liberation from the habitual patterns of thought.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Concept of No-Self in Buddhism:** The recognition that there is no permanent self can resonate with this inquiry into identity.  
- **Non-Dual Awareness:** Philosophies that emphasize the dissolution of the separate self in favor of a universal consciousness connect with the inquiry into 'who is the inquirer.'  
- **Existential Philosophy:** Exploration of existence and essence in thinkers like Kierkegaard or Sartre can provide insightful parallels.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That:** By Nisargadatta Maharaj, which explores non-duality and the inquiry into who we truly are.  
- **Being and Time:** By Martin Heidegger, which delves into concepts of being and existence.  
- **The Book of Not Knowing:** By Peter Ralston, which addresses self-inquiry and the nature of knowledge.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does identifying the inquirer affect your understanding of self and consciousness on your spiritual journey?
