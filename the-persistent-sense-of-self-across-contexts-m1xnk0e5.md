**Note 2: The Nature of 'I Am-ness'**  
**Title:** The Persistent Sense of Self Across Contexts  
**Quote:** "But the ‘I Am’ is felt in the dream state also."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The sense of existence, characterized by ‘I Am’, is not confined to waking life, but is also present in the dream realm.  

**Explanation:** This statement underscores the omnipresence of awareness and the continuous experience of self (the ‘I Am’) throughout varied states of reality. The notion that one can feel ‘I Am-ness’ during dreams suggests a deeper truth about identity that transcends physical and temporal limitations. It highlights the idea that self-awareness is a constant, unchanging aspect of consciousness, regardless of external circumstances. Recognizing this makes it easier to see oneself as fundamentally connected to a larger experience of existence, fostering deeper self-acceptance and exploration of one's spiritual journey.

**Connections:**  
- **Existential Philosophy:** Exploration of the self and existence beyond physical realities, such as thought and feeling.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Engaging with present-moment awareness enhances the relationship with the ‘I Am’ experience.  
- **Transpersonal Psychology:** A field that emphasizes spiritual experiences and the transcendence of self beyond ordinary psychological understanding.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which speaks to the importance of present awareness and the nature of consciousness.  
- **A Course in Miracles:** A spiritual text focused on the journey of self-discovery and the realization of unity.  
- **Being and Nothingness:** By Jean-Paul Sartre, an examination of consciousness, the self, and existence in philosophical discourse.  

**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways does recognizing a persistent sense of self across various states of consciousness alter your perception of identity and existence?
