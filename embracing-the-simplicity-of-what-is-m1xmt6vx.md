**Note 3: The Simplicity of Existence**  
**Title:** Embracing the Simplicity of 'What Is'  
**Quote:** "So just what is, is just what is."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The fundamental truth of existence is simply that things are as they are, without additional layers of complexity.  
**Explanation:** This statement encapsulates a profound simplicity in the nature of existence. Accepting 'what is' invites a form of mindfulness that encourages appreciating the present moment without clinging to past regrets or future anxieties. This way of being leads to a deeper connection with reality as it exists, rather than how it is idealized or complicated in our minds. By embracing the simplicity inherent in existence, we can foster a calm demeanor, cultivate acceptance, and reduce unnecessary mental agitation, which ultimately opens pathways for personal and spiritual growth.  
**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness Practice:** Techniques that emphasize present-moment awareness resonate with the acceptance of existence as it is.  
- **Zen Philosophy:** The idea of ‘just sitting’ (Shikantaza) reflects a form of meditation that embodies the acceptance of ‘what is.’  
- **Existentialist Thought:** Philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre emphasize the absurdity and simplicity of existence, discussing how one can find meaning irrespective of life’s inherent chaos.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Miracle of Mindfulness:** By Thich Nhat Hanh, which outlines practices for being present in the moment.  
- **Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind:** By Shunryu Suzuki, exploring the principles of Zen practice and mindset.  
- **Existentialism is a Humanism:** By Jean-Paul Sartre, presenting core ideas of existentialism and acceptance of human experience.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can you cultivate a mindset that embraces simplicity in your own life, allowing you to experience existence without the burdens of complexity and expectation?
