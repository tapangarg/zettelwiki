**Note 2: Confirmation of Awareness**  
**Title:** The Veracity of Awareness Statement  
**Quote:** "How do I confirm that I am aware? Why do I use these words ‘I am aware’? Why would I say ‘I am aware’ if it was not the truth?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** How can I validate my experience of awareness? What compels me to proclaim 'I am aware'? What’s the basis for this assertion if it were not true?  
**Explanation:** This section engages with the way we communicate our state of being, particularly concerning awareness. The question centers on the manner in which we acknowledge our existence as conscious beings and the instinctive truth behind the phrase 'I am aware'. It reflects on the inherent quality of perception; despite the complexities of existence, the act of asserting one's awareness reveals a deep truth that transcends simple verbal expression. This understanding acts as a cornerstone for discerning reality, guiding individuals toward deeper self-awareness and authenticity. Emphasizing our acknowledgment of awareness acknowledges the core of human experience, highlighting it as an essential element for growth in understanding oneself and existence.  
**Connections:**  
- **Philosophical Inquiry on Consciousness:** Philosophers such as Descartes with "I think, therefore I am" resonate with this internal verification of existence.  
- **Experiential Reality in Meditation:** Meditation practices often focus on awareness as a tool for inner verification and deeper connection with one's true self.  
- **Existential Psychology:** This reflects themes in existential psychology, where acknowledging awareness leads to understanding one’s place in the universe.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion** by Sam Harris which discusses consciousness and the nature of awareness in depth.  
- **Consciousness Explained** by Daniel Dennett, exploring the mechanisms underlying the awareness experience.  
- **Being Aware of Being Aware** by Tarthang Tulku, which examines the nuances of self-awareness from a Buddhist perspective.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does the realization of one’s awareness influence the choices we make and our interactions within our environments?
