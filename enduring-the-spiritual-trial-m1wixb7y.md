**Note 2: The Experience of Spiritual Trials**

**Title:** Enduring the Spiritual Trial

**Quote:** "The memory of the ineffable grace I had received was a real spiritual trial for me for the next four years."

**Explanation:** This passage reveals the paradox of spiritual experiences turning into trials. What initially was a source of divine happiness became a burden due to its ineffability and the reactions of others. This trial persisted for years, emphasizing the idea that spiritual paths are not always illuminated and can involve prolonged periods of struggle. The narrator learns humility and self-awareness through enduring this trial, broadening understanding of spiritual growth's complexities.
