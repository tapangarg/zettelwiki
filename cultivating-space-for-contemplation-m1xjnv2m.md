**Note 3: The Importance of Contemplation**  
**Title:** Cultivating Space for Contemplation  
**Quote:** "when we are just constantly attracted to and consumed by our thoughts, giving them our attention and belief, then there is no room for further contemplation."  
**Translation into Modern English:** If we continually fixate on and invest our belief in our thoughts, we lack the mental space necessary for deeper contemplation.  
**Explanation:** This insight illustrates a critical truth about mental engagement. When we find ourselves preoccupied with our thoughts—believing in them and allowing them to dominate our consciousness—there is little room remaining for reflection or deeper contemplation. This scenario creates a cycle of distraction and superficial engagement that impedes personal growth and understanding. By becoming adept at allowing thoughts to arise without clinging to them, we create a spaciousness within our mind. This space is crucial for contemplation, as it aids in accessing deeper levels of insight and facilitating a greater understanding of our true nature. The cultivation of this skill is vital for personal development, as it enables more profound reflection and connection to inner wisdom.
