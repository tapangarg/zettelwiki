**Note 1: The Nature of Awareness During Deep Sleep**  
**Title:** Understanding Awareness in the Context of Deep Sleep  
**Quote:** "The Knowing that there is no phenomenal thing in sleep state, this Knowing-ness Itself is what I call Awareness."  
**Explanation:** In this discourse, Ananta addresses a common query about the nature of consciousness during deep sleep. The speaker suggests that the attributes we associate with consciousness do not apply to the state of deep sleep. Traditionally, deep sleep is perceived as a lack of awareness or presence, often stated as "there is nothing in the sleep state." However, Ananta reframes this perception by identifying the "Knowing-ness"—the awareness that remains despite the absence of phenomenal experiences— as the essence of Awareness itself. This insight prompts us to consider that awareness does not cease in deep sleep but rather transforms into a state devoid of attributes, where the essence of consciousness exists beyond thoughts of self. This understanding is significant for spiritual growth as it invites deeper exploration of awareness beyond the dualistic notions of presence and absence.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Dual Awareness:** The understanding of consciousness that transcends dualities is central in many Eastern philosophies.  
- **States of Consciousness:** This can relate to different states of consciousness such as waking, dreaming, and deep sleep in various philosophical and psychological frameworks.  
- **Mindfulness and Presence:** The practice of mindfulness emphasizes awareness in the present moment, contrasting with experiences of altered states like sleep.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now** by Eckhart Tolle, which explores presence and consciousness.  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, a work delving into the nature of self and awareness.  
- **The Book of Not Knowing** by Peter Ralston, addressing consciousness and self-awareness in depth.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does the understanding of awareness during deep sleep influence your perception of consciousness and its continuous nature beyond waking and dreaming states?
