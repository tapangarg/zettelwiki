**Note 1: Reflection on Childhood Grief**  
**Title:** The Contrast of Childhood and Adult Perspectives on Death  
**Quote:** "The coffin appeared large and dismal" (S 48).  
**Translation into Modern English:** When I was a four-year-old child facing my mother's death, the coffin looked enormous and terrifying to me.  
**Explanation:** Thérèse highlights the profound impact of childhood grief, noting how as a young child, the enormity of death felt overwhelming and filled with despair. This experience illustrates how innocence makes encounters with death intensely fearful, laden with confusion and sorrow.  
**Connections:**

- **Faith and Grief in Different Stages of Life:** Various spiritual teachings offer insights into the evolution of our understanding of death and grief as we mature.  
- **The Role of Innocence in Grief:** The loss of innocence often accompanies profound grief experiences, marking a pivotal point in emotional development.
