**Note 1: The Nature of Awareness**  
**Title:** Distinguishing Between 'I' and Awareness  
**Quote:** “So, this ‘I’ that is aware even of attention, what about this one? When we say ‘aware of’ is there something separate; ‘of’...? Where is this Awareness in relation to this ‘I’?”  
**Translation into Modern English:** The speaker reflects on the concept of self-awareness, questioning the relationship between the self ('I') and the larger concept of Awareness. Is there a separation between these two entities, or are they intricately connected?  

**Explanation:** This note delves into a profound inquiry about the nature of self and consciousness. The speaker, while engaged in an exploration of awareness, questions whether the 'I,' the self-instance that recognizes attention, is indeed separate from the overarching experience of Awareness. This line of questioning challenges the common dichotomy between the ego ('I') and a broader consciousness, inviting introspection into how we perceive ourselves in relation to the greater flow of experience and awareness. 

The significance of this exploration lies in understanding how identification with the 'I' can create separateness, while a deeper awareness recognizes unity and interconnectedness. In teaching contexts, this exploration can lead to insights about the lesser-known dimensions of consciousness and personal identity, fostering a more integral view of self that is aligned with many contemplative practices.

**Connections:**  
- **Philosophy of Mind:** The distinction between 'I' and awareness can relate to dualism vs. non-dualism discussions in philosophy, particularly as they pertain to consciousness studies.  
- **Eastern Philosophical Traditions:** Concepts from Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta often explore the relationship between the self and a universal consciousness, echoing the inquiries proposed in this text.  
- **Psychological Perspectives on Self-Identity:** Modern psychology's approach to self-awareness may offer insights into how our self-concept shapes and distorts our understanding of consciousness.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **"I Am That" by Nisargadatta Maharaj:** A foundational text in non-dual philosophy that explores the nature of consciousness and the self.  
- **"The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle:** A guide to understanding awareness and being present, examining how identification with the self can obstruct true consciousness.  
- **"The Mind Illuminated" by Culadasa (John Yates):** This work offers a meditation guide that explores awareness, attention, and the mind's nature through a Buddhist lens.  

**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways does the understanding of ‘I’ as a separate entity hinder our experience of pure awareness, and how might recognizing this interconnectedness transform our spiritual practice?
