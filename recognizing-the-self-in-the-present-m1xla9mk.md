**Note 2: The Importance of Now**  
**Title:** Recognizing the Self in the Present  
**Quote:** "If the truth is the truth then the truth must be Here. If the Self is the Self then the Self will not be found in the future; it must be recognized Now."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The essence of truth must be experienced in the present moment; realization of the self cannot be postponed to a future time but should occur now.  
**Explanation:** This statement encapsulates the urgency and significance of self-realization in the present moment. Many individuals may tend to search for their true selves in future aspirations or past experiences, overlooking the vital point that the Self is always available in the Here and Now. The focus on now serves as a reminder that enlightenment and understanding cannot be deferred; they must be grasped through direct and immediate experience. This perspective promotes an active engagement with one's existence, fostering a deeper connection to awareness and being.  
**Connections:**  
- **Existentialism:** Thinkers like Søren Kierkegaard and Jean-Paul Sartre focus on existence in the present moment, wherein individuals create meaning in their lives.  
- **Buddhism:** The teachings of Buddhism underscore the importance of being present and recognizing one’s true nature, much like the emphasis on now in this discussion.  
- **Time Perception in Psychology:** The psychological understanding of how humans perceive time, particularly the tendency to dwell on the past or worry about the future, relates directly to the practice of being in the now.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment** by Ram Dass, which presents stories emphasizing present-moment awareness.  
- **The Power of Mindfulness** by Jon Kabat-Zinn, discussing the importance of being present in one's life and how this affects mental well-being.  
- **Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion** by Sam Harris, which explores the nature of self and consciousness in the present.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What practices can I implement in my daily life to deepen my awareness of the self and remind myself to recognize the truth in each present moment?
