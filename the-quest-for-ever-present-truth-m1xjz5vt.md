**Note 2: The Pursuit of Truth**  
**Title:** The Quest for Ever-Present Truth  
**Quote:** "The truth must be here Now. That’s why I’m always saying that I’m not interested in the truth that is coming and going."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The true essence of truth is timeless and should be experienced in the present moment; transient truths hold no real value.  
**Explanation:** This assertion emphasizes the pursuit of an enduring, unchanging truth as opposed to fluctuating beliefs or experiences. The speaker underscores that insubstantial truths can lead to confusion and distraction, detracting from the significant understanding of what is genuinely real. Instead, engagement with the present moment is crucial to uncovering the authentic truth of existence. The emphasis on 'here and now' reinforces the practice of mindfulness, urging practitioners to look within instead of searching externally for validation or enlightenment.  
**Connections:**  
- **Present Moment Awareness:** Related to mindfulness practices across various traditions fostering presence in everyday life.  
- **Plato's Theory of Forms:** Explores the distinction between the impermanent physical world and the immutable world of ideas and truths.  
- **Socratic Philosophy of Truth:** Socrates emphasized understanding and seeking true knowledge over superficial conclusions or societal opinions.

- **The Art of Happiness by the Dalai Lama:** A guide to living in truth and joy based on present experiences rather than the past or future.  
- **The Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu:** Offers wisdom that encourages staying present and recognizing the truth in simplicity.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways does the pursuit of a greater truth distract you from acknowledging the deeper truth present in your daily life?
