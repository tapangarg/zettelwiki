**Note 2: The Importance of "Who is Aware"**  
**Title:** The Inquiry into the Observer of Awareness  
**Quote:** "Why do you say this ‘Who is aware of Awareness is very important’?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** A question arises regarding the significance of asking, 'Who is aware of Awareness?'  

**Explanation:** The inquiry into "Who is aware of Awareness?" serves as a crucial pivot in spiritual exploration. This line of questioning shifts the focus from simply acknowledging Awareness to understanding the nature of the observer or the consciousness that recognizes this Awareness. It suggests a deeper layer of self-investigation and points towards the relationship between the self and consciousness. By pondering this question, individuals can explore their identity and the nature of their awareness, ultimately leading to more profound insights into their existence and consciousness. This practice invites one to step aside from conceptual thinking and encourages a more intimate exploration of being.  

**Connections:**  
- **Self-Inquiry in Advaita Vedanta:** This technique involves questioning the nature of the self and the observer, revealing layers of identification and separation.  
- **Existential Philosophy:** Engages with questions of being and recognition of self in relation to existence.  
- **Psychological Self-Observation:** Studies of metacognition highlight the importance of awareness of one’s thought processes and behaviors.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **The Heart of Awareness: A Gnostic Primer** by David R. Hodge, exploring the nature of self-awareness and experiential understanding.  
- **Who Am I?** by Ramana Maharshi, which specifically addresses the concept of the self in relation to awareness.  
- **The Mind Illuminated: A Complete Meditation Guide** by Culadasa (John Yates), which investigates awareness through the lens of meditation.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing the observer within us change our understanding of perception and our relationship with outer experiences?
