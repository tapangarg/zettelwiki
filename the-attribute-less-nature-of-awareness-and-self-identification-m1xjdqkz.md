**Note 7: Awareness and the Claim of 'I'**  
**Title:** The Attribute-less Nature of Awareness and Self-Identification  
**Quote:** "Awareness is attribute-less, so how is it arrogance to say 'I'?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Since awareness itself is free from attributes, asserting our identity as 'I' cannot be seen as arrogance.  
**Explanation:** This reflects a key insight into the nature of awareness and identity. When we acknowledge that awareness transcends any qualities or characteristics, the assertion of 'I' becomes a statement of existence rather than egoic arrogance. Recognizing this liberates us from the fear of self-claiming in an authentic manner, allowing for a deeper exploration of our essential nature.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality in Philosophy:** This concept aligns with non-dualistic teachings that emphasize the unity of existence.  
- **The Differentiation of Self and Ego:** Distinguishing the essential self from the egoic self to understand true identity.  
- **Mindfulness and Self-Identification:** How mindfulness practices help clarify the relationship between awareness, identity, and ego.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That:** By Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, which offers insights into the nature of 'I' and non-duality.  
- **A New Earth:** By Eckhart Tolle, discussing the ego and the potential for transformation through awareness.  
- **Talks with Ramana Maharshi:** Collection of teachings on the self and awareness from one of Indiaâ€™s most revered spiritual teachers.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can embracing the fundamental nature of awareness allow for a more authentic expression of self without the weight of ego?
