**Note 3: The Inquiry of the Self**  
**Title:** The Quest to Understand 'Me'  
**Quote:** "Now, what happens is that in satsang here, which is so direct, we look for this ‘me’. We look for this ‘me’..., who is this ‘me’?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** During direct teachings and discussions known as satsang, participants are encouraged to reflect deeply on their sense of self and identity, questioning the very essence of who they are.  
**Explanation:** This exploration of the self is a vital aspect of personal and spiritual development. By questioning the identity of 'me,' individuals can begin to dismantle constructed beliefs, societal labels, and illusions that inform their sense of self. Engaging in self-inquiry allows them to peel back layers of falsehood, ultimately leading to a clearer understanding of their true essence. This process is significant because it not only fosters self-awareness but encourages individuals to let go of their egos, revealing a more profound connection to existence itself. Such inquiry can also highlight the impermanence of identity, empowering individuals to recognize their intrinsic worth beyond societal definitions.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Concept of Atman in Advaita Vedanta:** The inquiry into one's true self resonates with the Hindu teaching that our true identity is the eternal soul, or Atman, which is indistinguishable from the divine.  
- **Buddhist Anatta (Non-Self):** This is the doctrine that emphasizes the illusion of a permanent self, paralleling the journey of questioning ‘who am I?’  
- **Existentialism:** This philosophical perspective encourages self-exploration and grappling with the essence of existence and identity.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"I Am That" by Nisargadatta Maharaj:** A series of dialogues exploring the nature of self and consciousness, focusing on the question of 'Who am I?'  
- **"The Book of Not Knowing" by Peter Ralston:** A transformative exploration of self-identity and the ways we can come to understand consciousness.  
- **"Radical Acceptance" by Tara Brach:** Discusses the importance of accepting oneself as a means to connect with one's true nature and alleviate suffering.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What beliefs about who you are have you formed through external influences, and how can examining these beliefs lead to a clearer sense of your authentic self?
