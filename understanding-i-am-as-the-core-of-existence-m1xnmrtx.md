**Note 2: The Essence of Self and Existence**

**Title:** Understanding ‘I Am’ as the Core of Existence

**Quote:** "God Is what Is. And I Am What Is."

**Translation into Modern English:** God embodies existence itself, and my own existence (the ‘I Am’) is an extension of that fundamental reality.

**Explanation:** Here, the text draws a profound connection between the recognition of one's own existence ('I Am') and the understanding of God as the ultimate reality. The phrase 'What Is' encapsulates both the essence of divinity and the essence of self, suggesting that acknowledging one's existence is also acknowledging the divine presence. This understanding reflects a fundamental truth: everything we perceive flows from our consciousness, and thus, our self-awareness is the gateway to comprehending God. This intersection of identity and divinity points to the indelible link between the self and the greater universe, offering a potent foundation for spiritual growth and insight.

**Connections:**

- **Advaita Vedanta:** A non-dualistic school of thought in Hindu philosophy that emphasizes the oneness of Atman (self) and Brahman (the ultimate reality).
- **Mystical Experiences Across Traditions:** The idea of unity with the divine as evidenced in the lived experiences of various mystics, indicating a universal truth in existential recognition.

**Further Reading:**
- **The Upanishads:** Ancient texts central to Hindu philosophy, emphasizing the connection between Atman and Brahman.
- **The Enneagram of Parenting:** By Elizabeth Wagele, which explores the concept of self-awareness and existence from psychological and spiritual perspectives.
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, focusing on the awareness of the present moment and its relationship to self and existence.

**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can the profound recognition of ‘I Am’ influence my path toward spiritual realization and understanding of the divine?
