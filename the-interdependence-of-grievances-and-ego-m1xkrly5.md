**Note 3: The Collapse of Ego**  
**Title:** The Interdependence of Grievances and Ego  
**Quote:** "I don't feel the ego can survive unless it has a grievance."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The ego relies on grievances for its continued existence.  
**Explanation:** Here, the author presents a critical perspective on the ego, suggesting that it draws strength from grievances and victimhood. Grievances serve as fundamental pillars upholding the ego, and without them, the ego begins to collapse. This realization is paramount for personal growth, as it invites individuals to investigate the grievances that prop up their egos and to challenge the notion of self that is predicated on victimization and blame. To dismantle these pillars is to embark on a path of liberation from the ego's constraints.
