**Note 2: The Observer and the States of Consciousness**  
**Title:** The Challenge of Objectivity in the Waking Dream  
**Quote:** "If you were just an object, then would you notice the coming and going of the dream?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** If your existence was limited to being a mere object, would you be capable of observing the changes in your dreams or in your life?  
**Explanation:** This statement raises an important distinction between being an observer versus being an object within experience. It suggests a deeper aspect of consciousness â€” that true awareness cannot merely be objectified. If one identifies solely as a body or a thought, they cannot fully comprehend the processes of change they undergo, as objects do not possess awareness. This line of thought is crucial in spiritual and philosophical contexts, as it challenges us to discern between our identification with forms and the awareness that allows us to perceive those forms. It signifies the importance of recognizing oneself as consciousness that observes rather than an object being observed.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Dual Awareness:** Many spiritual traditions point to the reality of non-duality, wherein the observer and the observed are understood as one infinite being.  
- **Phenomenology:** This philosophical approach emphasizes the study of experience and consciousness, focusing on how we perceive and interpret reality.  
- **Siddhartha and the Path to Enlightenment:** Hermann Hesse's novel explores the journey of self-awareness beyond physical and mental constructs.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which emphasizes living in the present moment and recognizing the self beyond the mind.  
- **The Untethered Soul:** By Michael A. Singer, detailing the journey toward understanding consciousness as distinct from thoughts and emotions.  
- **I Am That:** By Nisargadatta Maharaj, which explores non-duality and the nature of self-awareness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can recognizing yourself as the observer affect your experiences and relationships with the changing states of mind and emotion?
