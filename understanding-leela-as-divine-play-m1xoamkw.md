**Note 2: The Divine Dance of Existence**

**Title:** Understanding Leela as Divine Play  
**Quote:** "Leela: The Divine play or dance of existence."  
**Explanation:** Leela encapsulates the idea that the universe and our experiences within it are part of a divine play, not to be taken too seriously, but rather to be appreciated for their transient beauty. This notion suggests that life is both joyous and playful, allowing seekers to shift perspectives from suffering to a more liberated understanding of existence. Recognizing that our experiences are part of a playful divine will can lead to detachment from material concerns and a deeper appreciation of the impermanence and interconnectedness of all things.
