**Note 2: The Intersection of Surrender and Inquiry**  
**Title:** Unifying Surrender and Inquiry in Spiritual Growth  
**Quote:** "Then we must continue to inquire and say ‘Who is it that is in control right now in the first place?’ Then you see that both are the same thing actually."  
**Translation into Modern English:** We should ask ourselves who or what is actually in control of our experiences, as the act of inquiry and the act of surrender are intrinsically linked.  
**Explanation:** This statement emphasizes the relationship between surrender and inquiry, suggesting that they are two sides of the same coin in spiritual growth. When we inquire into our motivations and the concept of control, we often discover that our fears stem from a misunderstanding of our own nature. As we engage in self-inquiry, we begin to unravel the layers of our ego, which often seeks to maintain control. This inquiry leads to a deeper level of understanding that can enhance our ability to surrender—notably, both practices promote a return to our true essence. Together, they create a holistic approach to spirituality that encourages insight and trust.  
**Connections:**  
- **The Philosophy of Advaita Vedanta:** This non-dualistic philosophy emphasizes the oneness of existence, raising questions about control and identity that resonate with here.  
- **Meditative Practices:** Various meditation techniques encourage the observation of thought processes which can lead to revelations about control and surrender.  
- **The Role of Ego in Spirituality:** Understanding how the ego operates is essential for both surrender and inquiry, leading to personal insights and growth.
