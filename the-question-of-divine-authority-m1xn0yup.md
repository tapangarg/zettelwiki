**Note 2: Inquiry into the Nature of God**  
**Title:** The Question of Divine Authority  
**Quote:** "'Why should I bow down to Ram? I'm also God. What is He that I am not?'"  
**Translation into Modern English:** Why should I submit to Ram when I too am a divine being?  

**Explanation:** The quoted statement raises profound questions about authority and respect in a spiritual context. The speaker, through their assertion of divinity, reflects a common assertion found in non-dual philosophical traditions: that all beings share a divine essence. However, this can lead to a dangerous mindset where individuals might dismiss the role of spiritual teachers or the necessity of humility in oneâ€™s practice. Recognizing and honoring the path laid out by spiritual guides can be essential for growth, particularly in navigating complex spiritual concepts. The significance here lies in understanding that while we may all share the same divine essence, there is still value in learning from others who have traversed the path ahead of us. 

**Connections:**  
- **Spiritual Hierarchy in Eastern Traditions:** Many traditions emphasize different layers of spiritual authority and hierarchy, which are often overlooked in non-dual perspectives.  
- **The Dangers of Spiritual Pride:** A focus on one's divinity can sometimes lead to hubris, resulting in a disconnect from essential teachings and community.  
- **Role of Devotion in Spiritual Growth:** The practice of devotion, or bhakti, in various traditions emphasizes humility and the importance of surrendering to God or a teacher.

**Further Reading:**  
- **A Course in Miracles** by Helen Schucman, which elaborates on the relationship between the individual self and divine essence.  
- **The Tao Te Ching** by Laozi, which speaks about the nature of authority and wisdom in the context of spirituality.  
- **The Upanishads**, which explore the nature of the self and its relationship to the ultimate reality (Brahman) in a philosophical context.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How can acknowledging both your divinity and the role of external spiritual authorities enhance your growth on the spiritual path?
