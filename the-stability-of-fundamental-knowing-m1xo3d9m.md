**Note 2: The Concept of Undifferentiated Knowing**  
**Title:** The Stability of Fundamental Knowing  
**Quote:** "But it is fundamentally that the Knowing of this phenomenal tasting remains unchanged."  
**Translation into Modern English:** However, the essential knowing associated with the act of tasting is constant and unaltered.  

**Explanation:** This statement posits that despite the myriad experiences and perceptions we may engage with, the fundamental aspect of knowing remains constant. This suggests that while our individual experiences (like tasting, feeling, or seeing) can vary greatly, the underlying awareness or consciousness that recognizes these experiences does not fluctuate. This principle has significant implications for personal development and cognitive theories, as it invites us to consider the enduring aspects of consciousness amidst transient experiences. 

**Connections:**  
- **Buddhist Perspectives on Mind and Awareness:** Concepts of the unchanging mind can be found in Buddhist teachings that emphasize consciousness as a constant amidst changing phenomena.  
- **Theories of Object Permanence in Developmental Psychology:** This notion of a consistent knowing relates to how children develop understanding of objects remaining despite being out of sight.  
- **Jungian Psychology and the Collective Unconscious:** Jungâ€™s ideas on the persistent structures of consciousness can be linked to this discussion, as both touch upon elements of the persistent self amidst fluctuating experiences.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, which discusses the notion of the self and awareness that remains constant amid changing circumstances.  
- **Selfless Insight: Zen and the Mind** by Stephen Batchelor, exploring awareness and the constancy within the Zen tradition.  
- **The Power of Now** by Eckhart Tolle, which emphasizes present-moment awareness and the unchanging nature of consciousness.  

**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can recognizing the unchanging aspect of knowing influence our approach to change and impermanence in our lives?
