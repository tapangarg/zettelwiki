**Note 2: The Purpose of Inquiry**  
**Title:** The True Aim of Spiritual Inquiry  
**Quote:** "The inquiry is not to give peace to this non-existent one but to show you that this one doesn’t exist in the first place."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The purpose of inquiry is not to grant peace to the imagined self, but rather to reveal that this self is a construct that doesn’t actually exist.  
**Explanation:** This statement emphasizes that the fundamental goal of spiritual inquiry is not to attain peace or happiness for an individual, but to discover the truth about the self. Traditional approaches often mistake the end objective as achieving personal peace; however, true inquiry leads to the realization that there is no separate self to be satisfied or fulfilled. Understanding this helps dissolve attachments, leading to greater clarity and true peace that arises from the recognition of the interconnectedness of all life, rather than the fulfillment of individual desire. This is significant because it redirects the focus from personal gain to the broader understanding of existence.  
**Connections:**  
- **Self-Realization in Eastern Traditions:** Similar to the goal of various Eastern philosophies that advocate for the understanding of the true self beyond illusion.  
- **The Role of Awareness in Transformative Practices:** Awareness practices that focus on the non-duality of experience versus individual perception, as seen in various contemplative practices.  
- **The Zen Approach to Suffering and Desire:** Zen teachings that emphasize the collapse of desire as a pathway to enlightenment, supporting the idea that seeking can perpetuate suffering.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Direct Path: A User Guide** by Greg Goode focuses on self-inquiry and its implications for recognizing the non-dual nature of consciousness.  
- **Who Am I?** by Ramana Maharshi, a classic text on self-inquiry that delves into the nature of the self and the mechanisms of true peace and understanding.  
- **Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind** by Shunryu Suzuki, which discusses the essence of Zen practice and the importance of beginner’s mind in transcending individual self-concepts.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can you shift your approach to inquiry, moving past the aim of personal comfort to seek a deeper understanding of existence itself?
