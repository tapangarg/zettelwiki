**Note 1: The Essence of Being in Phenomenal Play**

**Title:** The Unity of Being and Phenomenal Existence

**Quote:** "Being, in the Presence of which this entire phenomenal leela, this phenomenal play starts; and also concludes. Appears and dissolves within this one space of Being."

**Translation into Modern English:** The essence of Being is the foundational reality in which all of existence, described as a phenomenal play, originates and ultimately ends. Everything comes into existence and fades away within the inclusive space of this fundamental Being.

**Explanation:** This concept emphasizes the non-dual nature of existence, where all phenomena – the arising and dissolving of experiences – are manifestations within the greater context of Being itself. This realization leads to profound insights into the nature of reality, as it asserts that all forms of life and experience are connected and united within the singular essence of Being. It shifts the perspective from viewing the universe as a collection of separate, disparate entities to understanding it as a unified play or expression of the singular reality.

**Connections:**
- **Non-Duality:** The philosophy that all distinctions and dualities are ultimately illusionary, with all existence being interconnected.
- **Leela in Hindu Philosophy:** The concept of the world as a divine play, suggesting that life’s events are unfolding like a cosmic drama, orchestrated by a higher power.
- **Awareness and Consciousness:** Exploring how the fundamental nature of awareness underlies our experiences and perceptions of reality.

**Further Reading:**
- **The Book of Not Knowing:** By Peter Ralston, which delves into concepts of existence, being, and consciousness.
- **I Am That:** By Nisargadatta Maharaj, a collection of dialogues that explore non-duality and the nature of self-awareness.
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which discusses the importance of being present and recognizing the deeper essence of existence.

**Question for Contemplation:** How does the understanding of being as the unified play of existence change your perspective on the events and experiences of your life?
