**Note 1: The Loss of Childlike Receptivity**

**Title:** Rediscovering Childlike Wonder

**Quote:** "As we grow older and become worldly-wise and sophisticated, we become hardened to the beauty that life sets before us."

**Translation into Modern English:** As we age and gain worldly experience and sophistication, we become desensitized to the beauty that the world offers.

**Explanation:** As people age, their increased exposure to the complexities and pressures of adult life often results in a dulling of their sensitivity to life's simple and beautiful moments. This gradual hardening can lead one to become desensitized to the everyday wonders they once easily noticed in their youth. The loss of childlike receptivity is a significant but often unrecognized contributor to the dissatisfaction and stress that accompanies many adult lives. Rediscovering this sense of awe and wonder can bring back joy, peace, and gratitude. 

**Connections:**
- **Mindfulness:** The practice of being present and fully engaged with the current moment, devoid of distraction.
- **Romanticism:** The literary movement that valued emotion and individualism, often focusing on the beauty and power of nature.
- **Flow State:** A completely immersed state of energizing focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of an activity.

**Further Reading:**
- **“The Little Prince” by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry:** A novel that explores themes of childlike wonder and the beauty of life.
- **“Walden” by Henry David Thoreau:** A reflection on simple living in natural surroundings.
- **“Wherever You Go, There You Are” by Jon Kabat-Zinn:** A guide to mindfulness and meditation.

**Question for Contemplation:** How can we cultivate a renewed sense of childlike appreciation for the everyday moments in our lives?

## Original Content

As we grow older and become worldly-wise and sophisticated, we become hardened to the beauty that life sets before us. The harried, hurried, pace of modern living beats out of us the freshness of childhood’s receptivity. One simple way to begin to recover this receptivity is by slowing down and pausing to look at the world around us. One day as William Wordsworth was crossing Westminster Bridge in London, a bridge that he had crossed countless times before, he stopped and looked at the city about him. He captured what he had experienced that morning in his poem “Composed Upon Westminster Bridge, Sept. 3, 1803.” Earth has not any thing to show more fair; 
Dull would be he of soul who could pass by 
A sight so touching in its majesty. 
This city now doth like a garment wear 
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare, 
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie 
Open unto the fields, and to the sky, 
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air. 
Never did sun more beautifully steep 
In his first splendour valley, rock, or hill; 
Ne’er say I, never felt, a calm so deep! 
The river glideth at his own sweet will; 
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep, 
And all that mighty heart is lying still!11
