**Note 1: The Essence of Self-Inquiry**  
**Title:** The Root Question of Self-Inquiry  
**Quote:** "Ultimately, what we are looking for is an answer to the root question. We start off by looking for an answer to the root question which is 'Who am I?'"  
**Translation into Modern English:** At the core of self-inquiry is the quest for understanding who we truly are. This inquiry begins with the pivotal question: "Who am I?"  
**Explanation:** Self-inquiry is the practice of delving deeply into the nature of the self, understanding its true essence beyond the layers of identity, personality, and ego. The question "Who am I?" is not merely a query but an invitation to explore the authentic self, urging individuals to distinguish between their perceived identity and their true nature. This foundational inquiry facilitates a journey inward, prompting a reevaluation of beliefs and shedding the superficial layers that often cloud self-perception. Embracing this question with openness signifies a readiness to engage with the deeper truths of existence, moving beyond the confines of ego and societal conditioning. The importance of this inquiry lies in its potential to lead to greater self-awareness and, ultimately, liberation from false identification with the self.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality:** The exploration of self-inquiry aligns with non-dual teachings that emphasize the oneness of consciousness and the illusion of separateness.  
- **Ego Dissolution:** Understanding and questioning the ego is central to many spiritual practices, highlighting the transition from ego-centric to a more transcendent view of self.  
- **Meditative Inquiry:** Practices that incorporate meditative inquiry use the question “Who am I?” as a focal point for contemplation, facilitating deeper states of awareness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which discusses living fully in the present moment and exploring the nature of the self beyond ego.  
- **I Am That:** By Nisargadatta Maharaj, offering insights into self-inquiry and the exploration of consciousness and identity.  
- **Who Am I?: The Teachings of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi,** which delves into the classic inquiries about self-knowledge and realization.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does deeply engaging with the question "Who am I?" alter your perception of identity and your connection to the world around you?
