**Note 3: The Role of Humiliation and Self-Reflection**

**Title:** Embracing Humility Through Spiritual Humiliation

**Quote:** "humiliation becoming my lot, I was unable to look upon myself without a feeling of profound horror."

**Explanation:** The narrator's recounting of feeling humiliated after misunderstanding their vision demonstrates the transformative power of humiliation in spiritual growth. This experience forces a deep self-reflection, confronting the feeling of horror associated with one's perceived failings. The text suggests that sometimes spiritual growth requires humility through perceived failure, serving as a vehicle for deeper self-awareness and development of oneâ€™s spiritual character.
