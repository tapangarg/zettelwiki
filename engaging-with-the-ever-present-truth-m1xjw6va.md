**Note 1: The Nature of Truth**  
**Title:** Engaging with the Ever-Present Truth  
**Quote:** "The truth is here. We donâ€™t need to go looking around here and there to find the truth."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The truth is always right in this moment; we do not need to search for it elsewhere.  
**Explanation:** The speaker emphasizes that truth is not something we need to seek; instead, it is inherent in our current experience. This perspective invites us to shift our focus from the transitory nature of past experiences and future anticipations to the immediate reality. Engaging with truth as a constant presence helps us avoid the suffering associated with attachment to fleeting experiences. Understanding this can profoundly affect our spiritual growth and self-awareness, prompting us to develop a more present-focused consciousness.   
**Connections:**

- **Zen Buddhism:** The concept of living in the "now" is often emphasized in Zen, which teaches that enlightenment is found in the present moment.  
- **Existentialism:** Philosophical ideas suggesting that meaning and essence are derived from individual experience rather than from abstract concepts.
