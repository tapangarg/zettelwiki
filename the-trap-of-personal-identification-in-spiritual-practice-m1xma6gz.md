**Note 3: The Illusion of the Seeker**  
**Title:** The Trap of Personal Identification in Spiritual Practice  
**Quote:** "Otherwise it becomes personal and we feel our spiritual practice...should give us something personally."  
**Translation into Modern English:** If we do not keep emptiness as our focus, our spiritual practice risks becoming overly personal, leading us to expect personal benefits from it.  
**Explanation:** Here, the text points out the common pitfall in spiritual exploration: the temptation to conflate spiritual progress with personal gain or identity. When spiritual practices become personal, they risk being tainted by ego, inadvertently turning the search for self into a search for self-aggrandizement or rewards. This understanding is crucial as it highlights that the real goal of spiritual practice should be the exploration and realization of being rather than achieving personal outcomes. Recognizing this distinction serves as a fundamental pivot in a practitionerâ€™s journey, inviting them to cultivate a non-attachment that ultimately leads to deeper understanding and genuine transformation.  
**Connections:**  
- **Ego and Spiritual Awakening:** The discussion of how individuality and ego can cloud true enlightenment found in various philosophical and spiritual traditions.  
- **A Course in Miracles:** This course emphasizes the need for relinquishing personal goals in favor of deeper spiritual understanding.  
- **The Bhagavad Gita:** Themes of selfless duty and devotion resonate with the importance of transcending personal desires in spiritual practice.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Ego and The Id** by Sigmund Freud, examining the constructs of self and ego, useful in understanding their impact on spirituality.  
- **The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself** by Michael A. Singer, guiding readers on moving beyond the confines of personal identity.  
- **The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success** by Deepak Chopra, discussing success not as personal achievement but rather as alignment with universal principles.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can shifting your focus from personal achievements to a broader sense of awareness change your engagement with spiritual practices?
