**Note 2: The Exploration of 'I Am' and 'I-I'**  
**Title:** Contemplation on the 'I-I' and 'I Am' Concepts  
**Quote:** "There must be something here that is prior to the sense of this body; that which Bhagavan [Ramana Maharshi] called the ‘I-I’ and [Nisargadatta] Maharaj called the ‘I Am’."  
**Translation into Modern English:** There must be an aspect of ourselves that exists before identifying with our physical body, which Ramana Maharshi referred to as 'I-I' and Nisargadatta Maharaj as 'I Am'.  
**Explanation:** The terms 'I-I' and 'I Am' signify a profound acknowledgment of existence that transcends material identity. 'I-I' reflects an inner state that discerns itself, while 'I Am' speaks to the pure presence of being itself. These concepts serve as tools in spiritual practices, highlighting that our essence is more than our physical form or mental constructs. Through such contemplation, practitioners can develop a deeper awareness of their fundamental nature.  
**Connections:**  
- **Direct Path Teachings:** The practice of understanding one's true nature, often examined in non-dual spiritual teachings.  
- **Existentialism:** A philosophical inquiry into what it means to exist, where individuals confront the fundamental aspects of their being.  
- **Mindfulness and Presence:** The practice of being aware in the moment, which aligns with the recognition of self beyond thoughts and physicality.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The New Earth** by Eckhart Tolle, a discussion on the egoic mind and the insight into being.  
- **Self-Realization: The Discourse of the Bhagavad Gita** by Swami Prabhupada, which delves into the concept of transcendental tranquility beyond the body.  
- **The Spiritual Teaching of Ramana Maharshi** by Arthur Osborne, a resource comprehensively covering Maharshi’s insights.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways does the understanding of ourselves as 'I-I' or 'I Am' challenge societal constructs of identity and self-worth?
