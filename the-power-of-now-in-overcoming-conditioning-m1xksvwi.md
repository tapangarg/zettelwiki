**Note 3: The Role of the Present Moment**  
**Title:** The Power of 'Now' in Overcoming Conditioning  
**Quote:** "The ‘Now’ is the biggest help because right now there is no conditioning."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The present moment holds transformative power because there is no conditioning present in it.  
**Explanation:** Here, the text highlights the significance of the present moment as a means of transcending conditioning and illusion. Often, our minds are preoccupied with past experiences or future anticipations, which create layers of conditioning that obscure our true nature. By centering ourselves in the 'Now', we can bypass these distractions and connect with the essence of Awareness that remains unchanged. Practicing presence not only allows for authentic experiences but also facilitates a deeper understanding of oneself and one's relationship with the world. This is transformative for personal growth, as it encourages a sense of freedom and clarity.
