**Note 2: The Essence of 'I' in Consciousness**  
**Title:** Distinguishing Between the ‘I’ of Being and Awareness  
**Quote:** "When you say ‘I believe my thought’ which ‘I’ are you referring to? This ‘I’ that is Being; not the Awareness of this Being, the Being itself."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When you express belief in a thought, it's crucial to discern which aspect of 'I' you are referencing; it's about the essence of existence (Being) rather than the awareness that observes existence.  
**Explanation:** This quote highlights a vital philosophical distinction between the 'I' that embodies existence (Being) and the 'I' that serves as an observer (Awareness). The commentary suggests that many people conflate their identity with their thoughts and beliefs, missing the deeper essence of what it means to be. By recognizing the difference, one can transcend identity-related struggles and navigate through beliefs without being consumed by them. Understanding this separation is pivotal for personal growth; it facilitates a more profound inquiry into the self beyond transient thoughts, moving towards a more stable state of being that isn't swayed by the whims of belief.  
**Connections:**  
- **Existentialism:** The philosophy that examines individual existence, freedom, and choice can be aligned with the understanding of the true 'I' beyond defined beliefs.  
- **Nonduality in Advaita Vedanta:** This tradition emphasizes the oneness of Atman (the Self) and Brahman (universal consciousness), echoing the sentiment of recognizing the true essence of Being.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques that advocate for observing thoughts without attachment encourage a similar separation between self and thought.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Being and Time** by Martin Heidegger, which delves deep into concepts of Being and existence.  
- **I Am That** by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, exploring the nature of identity and consciousness through dialogues on non-duality.  
- **The Untethered Soul** by Michael A. Singer, discussing ways to liberate oneself from identifying with thoughts.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways might you start to distinguish between your true essence and the thoughts you observe, and how could this change your perception of identity?
