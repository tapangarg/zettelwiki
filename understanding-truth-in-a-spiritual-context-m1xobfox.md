**Note 4: The Nature of Truth**  
**Title:** Understanding Truth in a Spiritual Context  
**Quote:** "Truth: That which cannot be altered and is common to all beings."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Truth refers to a reality that is unchangeable and universally shared among all beings.  
**Explanation:** The exploration of Truth is a foundational aspect of many philosophical and spiritual traditions. It represents an absolute reality, existing beyond subjective perceptions and experiences. This definition of Truth is significant as it invites individuals to look beyond their personal experiences, biases, and limited perspectives to engage with a more profound, universal understanding of existence. In recognizing that Truth is common to all beings, individuals can cultivate empathy and a sense of unity with others, which can lead to a more harmonious existence and deeper spiritual insights. Understanding Truth in this way encourages seekers to question their beliefs and to pursue wisdom that transcends the ego-driven narratives of individual experience.
