**Note 1: The Essence of Awareness**  
**Title:** Exploring the Nature of Existence and Consciousness  
**Quote:** "Now notice the sense that ‘I am here’. The sense that ‘I exist’. The feeling of existence, that ‘I Am’."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Recognize the fundamental awareness that comes with the experience of being present and existing; this feeling captures the essence of one's own existence.  
**Explanation:** The concept of awareness is illuminating the crucial aspect of self-recognition in our journey of understanding existence. The passage emphasizes a reflective exploration of the sense of self and being, urging an inquiry into the nature of awareness. By distinguishing between the 'I' that exists and the awareness itself, it invites us to transcend the distractions of physical existence and to discover the deeper "I" that understands and witnesses existence. This differentiation between the perceiver and the perceived hints at a profound spiritual realization that can lead to personal transformation, growth, and an increased sense of connectedness with the universe.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Dual Awareness:** The idea reflects teachings from non-dual philosophies, particularly in Advaita Vedanta, which emphasizes the oneness of the observer and the observed.  
- **Mindfulness and Presence:** This quest for understanding self-awareness resonates with mindfulness practices that emphasize presence, acceptance, and observation without attachment.  
- **Existential Philosophy:** The inquiry into "Who am I?" has significant ties to existentialist thought, which explores individual existence, freedom, and the meaning of life.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **"I Am That" by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj** - A key text in understanding non-dual awareness and the nature of self.  
- **"The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle** - A guide on living in the present and recognizing the essence of self-awareness.  
- **"Being and Nothingness" by Jean-Paul Sartre** - For insight into existentialist views on being and consciousness.  
**Question for Contemplation:** What does it mean to truly "know" oneself beyond the attributes and perceptions that continuously change?
