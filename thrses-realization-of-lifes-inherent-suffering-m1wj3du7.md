Note 2: Thérèse’s Awakening to the Reality of Life's Suffering

**Title:** Thérèse’s Realization of Life’s Inherent Suffering

**Quote:** “In one instant, I understood what life was; until then, I had never seen it so sad; but it appeared to me in all its reality, and I saw it was nothing but a continual suffering and separation.”

**Translation into Modern English:** Thérèse suddenly realized that life is inherently sad, full of suffering and continuous separation.

**Explanation:** This quote captures a pivotal moment in Thérèse’s understanding of life as intrinsically linked with sorrow and continual partings. Such moments of clarity about life's hardships often come at significant turning points, compelling individuals to confront the transient nature of human experiences. Thérèse’s awakening to this fact reflects a profound maturation, where innocence gives way to a nuanced recognition of the complexities and inevitabilities of life.
