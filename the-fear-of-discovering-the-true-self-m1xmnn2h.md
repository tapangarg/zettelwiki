**Note 1: The Fear of the Self**  
**Title:** The Fear of Discovering the True Self  
**Quote:** "This is exactly what we have been talking about, which is this fear of our own Self in a way. You see, this fear of our own Self..., because it is no-thing in the non-phenomenal sense."  
**Translation into Modern English:** We're discussing the fear that arises when we confront our true self, which, in a non-phenomenal sense, is beyond description as 'no-thing.'  
**Explanation:** The fear of the Self alludes to a deeper philosophical and spiritual inquiry into the nature of existence. This fear stems from misunderstanding the concept of the Self as being devoid of characteristics or essence ('no-thing') rather than grasping it as a true potential or existence. By perceiving the Self as 'nothing', one may negate their intrinsic value and worth. Recognizing this distinction helps forward spiritual growth by fostering a healthier relationship with the Self, encouraging individuals to embrace the deeper, non-phenomenal layers of their being instead of recoiling from them in fear.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-duality:** The concept that all things are interconnected and part of a single reality, which often leads to insights about the Self.  
- **Existential Philosophy:** Discussions around 'being' and 'nothingness' from thinkers such as Sartre or Heidegger, who explore the implications of existence.  
- **Mysticism:** Many spiritual traditions emphasize the importance of transcending the ego and understanding one's true nature beyond physical and mental identities.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **I Am That:** By Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, offering insights into the nature of the Self and ultimate reality from a non-dual perspective.  
- **The Power of Now:** By Eckhart Tolle, which discusses mindfulness and the importance of being present to confront the Self.  
- **Being and Time:** By Martin Heidegger, examining the concept of 'being' in a profound philosophical context.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does embracing the concept of 'no-thingness' challenge our perception of identity and alter our relationship with self-worth?
