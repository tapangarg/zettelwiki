**Note 3: The Nature of Truth and Perception**

**Title:** The Elusiveness of Truth in Personal Experience 

**Quote:** “It's never the truth because if somebody says 'I've seen it' then it's not true, it can never be true.”

**Translation into Modern English:** Personal experiences described as 'truth' lack the absolute quality traditionally associated with truth.

**Explanation:** This statement challenges conventional understandings of truth as something attainable or definitive through personal experience. The idea that if someone claims to ‘have seen’ truth negates its authenticity speaks to the subjective nature of perception—no experience can encapsulate the entirety of truth. This perspective aligns with non-dual teachings that assert that personal sightings or realizations often come filtered through the ego and thus cannot represent an absolute reality. Recognizing the limitations of individual perception allows a greater openness to the mystery of existence and a more profound inquiry into what ‘truth’ ultimately means.

**Connections:** 
- **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity:** The philosophical discussion surrounding whether truth is subjective (individual) or objective (universal) and its implications in spiritual contexts.
- **The Nature of Realization in Non-Duality:** The recognition of an underlying truth beyond personal experience and the articulation of that in spiritual discourse.
- **The Role of Language in Truth:** How language often fails to adequately express deep experiences of truth.

**Further Reading:** 
- **The Book of Not Knowing:** By Peter Ralston, which looks into the concept of knowledge versus direct experience.
- **The Tao of Pooh:** By Benjamin Hoff, illustrating that truth can often reside in simplicity beyond complex explanations.
- **The Untethered Soul:** By Michael A. Singer, which explores concepts of consciousness and the self beyond individual perspectives.

**Question for Contemplation:** How does our understanding of truth change when we consider the limitations of personal experience and the influences of ego in our perception?
