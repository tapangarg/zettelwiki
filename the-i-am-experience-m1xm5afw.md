**Note 3: The Primordial Sense of Existence**  
**Title:** The 'I Am' Experience  
**Quote:** "That which is aware even of the sense of Presence, the primordial sense that ‘I exist’. ‘I Am’."  
**Translation into Modern English:** There exists a fundamental awareness that recognizes the very essence of being, the basic acknowledgment that one exists—'I Am.'  
**Explanation:** This profound statement encourages deep contemplation regarding the root of consciousness and existence. The phrase 'I Am' signifies the foundational experience of being and awareness that precedes thoughts, feelings, and sensory perceptions. Understanding this concept leads us to the realization that our identity is not anchored to transient thoughts, but to an essential consciousness that simply 'is.' This foundational awareness serves as a touchstone for spiritual growth and self-realization, offering a path toward understanding the deeper aspects of existence and the nature of reality itself. Recognizing and experiencing this 'I Am' can liberate individuals from the confines of ego and external definitions, revealing a broader perspective on life.  
**Connections:**  
- **Existential Philosophy:** Discussions around being and existence, especially in the works of philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre, reflect the 'I Am' consciousness and its implications.  
- **Buddhist Philosophy of Anatta:** The non-self concept in Buddhism invites a similar dialogue about existence being rooted in awareness rather than a fixed identity.  
- **Kabbalistic Teachings:** Jewish mystical traditions explore the concept of divine presence ('Ein Sof') as a way to understand existence and connection with the divine.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Being and Time:** By Martin Heidegger, which explores the meaning of being and existence from a philosophical perspective.  
- **The Book of Not Knowing:** By Peter Ralston, a guide to understanding consciousness and personal reality beyond thought.  
- **The Tao Te Ching:** By Laozi, which offers reflections on existence and the nature of being in a mystical context.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does recognizing the essence of 'I Am' shift your perception of the self, and what implications does this have for your understanding of existence?
