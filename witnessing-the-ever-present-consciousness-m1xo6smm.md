**Note 3: The Infinite Nature of Consciousness**  
**Title:** Witnessing the Ever-Present Consciousness  
**Quote:** "this primal witnessing that witnesses everything, including..."  
**Translation into Modern English:** This foundational aspect of awareness observes all phenomena, encompassing everything that emerges in the mind.  
**Explanation:** The idea of "primal witnessing" relates to the fundamental aspect of consciousness that is always present, observing without attachment or judgment. Recognizing that consciousness itself is not limited by thoughts or experiences underscores the transformative potential of engaging with this witness. It encourages practitioners to cultivate a state of awareness where they are not affected by the transient nature of thoughts and emotions, leading to the understanding that change occurs within a constant consciousness. This perspective fosters a sense of peace and stability, enhancing personal growth by promoting a clearer understanding of one's reality and the unfolding patterns of life.
