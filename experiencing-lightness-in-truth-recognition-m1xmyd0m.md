**Note 3: Lightness and Liberation in Recognition**  
**Title:** Experiencing Lightness in Truth Recognition  
**Quote:** "there is a great lightness that comes. 'Oh! It feels like there is no separation, there's no boundaries, it's so beautiful’."  
**Translation into Modern English:** In the moment of true recognition, one often experiences a profound lightness and a sense of oneness, free from notion of separation.  
**Explanation:** This feeling of lightness upon recognizing Truth represents an essential aspect of spiritual awakening. It often brings about a sense of interconnectedness and dissolves barriers created by ego. This experience is characterized by feelings of love, bliss, and deep appreciation for existence. The significance lies in understanding that such experiences, while uplifting, should not prompt the construction of spiritual ego but rather reinforce humility and compassion towards oneself and others.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality in Eastern Philosophies:** The sense of oneness with all exists within the teachings of Advaita Vedanta and other non-dualistic traditions.  
- **The Experience of Flow:** Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of flow parallels the lightness experienced in spiritual recognition, emphasizing engagement without the burdens of identity.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Meditation and mindfulness encourage the dissolution of ego and highlight experiences of oneness, aligning with the described feelings of lightness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Heart of the Buddha’s Teaching** by Thich Nhat Hanh, which discusses the experience of non-separation through mindfulness and compassion.  
- **A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose** by Eckhart Tolle, highlighting the transcendence of ego and embracing a broader perspective of existence.  
- **The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself** by Michael A. Singer, exploring deeper states of awareness and liberation from inner turmoil.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can you cultivate a practice that consistently brings you back to that feeling of lightness and oneness with existence in daily life?
