**Note 2: Thérèse’s Emotional Transformation and Her Protective Instincts**

**Title:** The Impact of Trauma on Emotional and Social Development

**Quote:** "I, once so full of life, became timid and retiring, sensitive to an excessive degree."

**Explanation:** The text delves into how the trauma of losing her mother transformed Thérèse’s personality from one that was vibrant to one withdrawn and overly sensitive. This emotional retreat is portrayed as a coping mechanism, illustrating a common response to trauma, where individuals may isolate themselves to protect against further emotional pain. This transformation highlights the delicate balance between self-preservation and the instinctual drive for emotional connection and growth. By reflecting on Thérèse’s experience, we gain insight into the universal challenge of managing trauma while striving to remain open and vulnerable.
