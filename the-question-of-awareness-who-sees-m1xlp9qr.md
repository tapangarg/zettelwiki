Note 2: The Inquiry of Awareness  
**Title:** The Question of Awareness: Who Sees?  
**Quote:** "If there is blank space, who is aware of that space?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** If there exists a void or empty space, what entity perceives this emptiness?  

**Explanation:** This inquiry invites a deep examination of the nature of perception and awareness. When faced with the concept of a 'blank space,' the essential question arises: Who or what is the observer of this perceived emptiness? This contemplation leads to an understanding that perception itself may not be limited to a sensory experience but instead involves a layer of consciousness that observes all experiences. This line of questioning is crucial for deeper awareness of self and existence, as it prompts individuals to explore layers of consciousness that may be taken for granted.  

**Connections:**  
- **Phenomenology:** The study of structures of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view, emphasizing ways of experiencing phenomena.  
- **Zen Buddhism:** The practice of direct inquiry into one's experience of awareness, often using koans to provoke deeper insight.  
- **Transpersonal Psychology:** This field examines spiritual aspects of the human experience and the potential for consciousness to transcend conventional boundaries.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **The Tao of Pooh** by Benjamin Hoff, which uses simple illustrations of Taoist principles to explore awareness and perception.  
- **The Mind Illuminated** by Culadasa, which blends a traditional Buddhist approach with modern neuroscience to examine consciousness.  
- **The Four Agreements** by Don Miguel Ruiz, which explores ways of understanding the self and one's perceptions in a practical way.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How does understanding the observer change the way I perceive my own experiences and reality?
