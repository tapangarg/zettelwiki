**Note 1: The Power of the Present Moment**  
**Title:** Embracing the NOW: Liberation from Conditioning  
**Quote:** "NOW is God. Just see how pristine it is that this moment is free from all conditioning; all the past history, ideas, beliefs, concepts: All gone."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The present moment is divine and untouched by any previous influences; it is entirely free from past experiences, preconceived notions, and personal beliefs.  
**Explanation:** This idea emphasizes the importance of being fully present and recognizes the transformative power of the present moment, untainted by past conditioning. It invites us to appreciate the purity of ‘NOW’ and challenges our tendencies to dwell on past experiences or future anxieties. The notion suggests that true liberation lies in our ability to disengage from mental clutter and embrace the reality of the present, effectively rejecting the negative impact of our thoughts and beliefs. This concept encourages cultivating mindfulness and awareness, crucial for personal growth and deeper understanding.  
**Connections:**  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques focused on cultivating awareness of the present moment, such as meditation, which align closely with this idea.  
- **Ramana Maharshi's Teaching:** The emphasis here connects with Ramana Maharshi's teachings about 'self-inquiry' and recognizing one's true nature beyond thoughts.  
- **Non-Duality:** The philosophy that there is no separation between the individual self and the universe, which resonates with the message of transcending thought.
