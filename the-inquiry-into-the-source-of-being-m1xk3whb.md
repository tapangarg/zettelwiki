**Note 2: Exploring the Origin of Awareness**  
**Title:** The Inquiry into the Source of Being  
**Quote:** "Prior to Being also, 'Am I aware?' That which is aware of Presence."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Even before the concept of existence or being, one can ask, 'Am I aware?' This leads to recognizing the aspect that acknowledges presence.  

**Explanation:** The speaker raises a pointed question about the nature of existence, posing the inquiry 'Am I aware?' This question invites a deeper introspection into the nature of consciousness itself. By implicating that awareness can exist even prior to the notion of being, it suggests that awareness is an independent and fundamental aspect of consciousness that underpins existence. This deeper exploration challenges the listener to reconsider what it means to ‘be,’ prompting awareness as a sort of precondition for existence. Understanding this can lead to profound existential insights where the relationship between awareness and being becomes apparent, revealing that awareness is intrinsic to the experience of life itself.  

**Connections:**  
- **Philosophy of Mind:** This concept touches on the debates about consciousness and awareness that have been central to philosophical thought throughout history.  
- **Eastern Philosophical Traditions:** The teachings of Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta discuss awareness as an essential aspect of existence.  
- **Neurology and Consciousness Studies:** The scientific study of consciousness offers a modern perspective that can complement philosophical inquiries into awareness.  

**Further Reading:**  
- **The Tao of Pooh:** By Benjamin Hoff, which provides insights into Eastern philosophies surrounding awareness through a playful lens.  
- **Awakening to the Dream:** By Leo Hartong, which elucidates the relationship between consciousness and existence in a non-dual framework.  
- **Consciousness Explained:** By Daniel Dennett, offering a scientific perspective on awareness and how it relates to being.  

**Question for Contemplation:** How does understanding awareness as a precursor to existence reshape my perception of reality and engage my inner sense of presence?
