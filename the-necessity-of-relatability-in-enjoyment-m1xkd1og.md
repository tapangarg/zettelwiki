**Note 1: The Role of Belief in Engagement**  
**Title:** The Necessity of Relatability in Enjoyment  
**Quote:** "You must find a relate-able character, you must want to kill the enemies of that character, you must achieve a mission, you see."  
**Translation into Modern English:** To truly enjoy a game, book, or movie, you need to connect with a character who resonates with you; this connection is fundamental to your engagement in the narrative.  
**Explanation:** The text explores the essential role belief plays in engaging with narrative forms such as video games, literature, and film. Without a relatable character or story, the chance of enjoying the experience diminishes significantly. This observation highlights that enjoyment arises not merely from the activity itself, but from our ability to immerse ourselves and identify with the characters' struggles and missions. In a way, this draws attention to our human nature's craving for connection and purpose, revealing how belief operates as the thread that weaves our understanding and enjoyment of artistic and narrative experiences. Significantly, this dynamic exposes the mechanism by which belief imbues our engagements with meaning, underscoring the insights into both entertainment and existence.  
**Connections:**  
- **Narrative Psychology:** The way stories shape identities and experiences; understanding how we relate to characters informs our self-conception.  
- **Existentialism:** The philosophical exploration of existence without inherent meaning demonstrates a connection to how belief and narrative shape our understanding of reality.  
- **Cognitive Appraisal in Enjoyment:** The psychological underpinnings of how our evaluations of narratives contribute to fulfillment and entertainment.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Hero with a Thousand Faces** by Joseph Campbell, which explores the universal patterns in narratives and their resonance with the human experience.  
- **The Power of Myth** by Joseph Campbell, presenting how mythology shapes human understanding and beliefs.  
- **The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human** by Jonathan Gottschall, discussing the evolution and significance of storytelling in human behavior.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does our ability to relate to characters influence our perception of reality, and what does that say about the narratives we construct in our daily lives?
