**Note 3: The Challenge of Present-Moment Inquiry**  
**Title:** Engaging in Inquiry Without Presumption  
**Quote:** "Just from the checking now, what do we find?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** From this moment of self-examination, what insights can we gain without relying on prior knowledge or assumptions?  

**Explanation:** The speaker emphasizes the necessity of approaching self-inquiry with a fresh perspective, free from assumptions or preconceived notions. This call to "check now" signifies the importance of engaging with one's thoughts and feelings in the present moment, rather than drawing conclusions based on past experiences. This practice encourages active observation of one’s inner experience and cultivates a mindset of curiosity and openness. It challenges practitioners to confront their thoughts and emotions authentically, which can lead to greater self-discovery and a more nuanced understanding of one’s inner world. The act of self-inquiry can facilitate personal growth by illuminating areas of misunderstanding or habitual thinking that may hinder one's development.
