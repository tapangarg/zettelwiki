**Note 3: The Constant Nature of Knowing**  
**Title:** The Ever-Present Knowing of Awareness  
**Quote:** “Awareness is always aware, and this is always 'I'.”  
**Translation into Modern English:** Awareness is perpetually conscious, and this consciousness is synonymous with the ‘I’ that we recognize.  
**Explanation:** This concept conveys the idea that the fundamental aspect of awareness does not fluctuate; it is a constant presence in our being. Regardless of the external circumstances, the awareness that we experience remains unchanged. It provides a platform from which we can observe our thoughts, emotions, and the ever-changing aspects of life. By understanding that ‘I’ refers not to the transient experiences but to this unchanging awareness, we gain insight into the stability and continuity of our true self. This recognition fosters a deeper peace, as we learn to differentiate between the temporary states of mind and the eternal essence of our being. Embracing this understanding allows us to cultivate resilience in navigating the uncertainties and fluctuations of life.
