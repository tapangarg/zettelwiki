**Note 2: Divine Protection and Intervention**

**Title:** The Watchful Care of the Queen of Heaven  

**Quote:** "But he did not know that the sweet Queen of Heaven was watching over her fragile little flower, that she was smiling on her from her throne in heaven and was preparing to stop the storm the moment her flower was to break without any hope of recovery."  

**Translation into Modern English:** But the demon was unaware that the gentle Queen of Heaven was looking after her delicate little flower, smiling down from her heavenly throne, and was ready to halt the storm at the moment her flower seemed about to break irreparably.  

**Explanation:** St. Thérèse speaks of the Virgin Mary, often referred to as the "Queen of Heaven," as a protective and nurturing force. This illustrates the belief in divine intervention and maternal guardianship of heavenly figures who provide solace and protection, particularly in times of dire need.
