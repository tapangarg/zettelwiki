**Note 1: The Nature of Prayer**  
**Title:** Understanding the Dimensions of Prayer  
**Quote:** "So depending on where we are the definition of Good prayer will keep changing isn't it?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** The definition of what constitutes good prayer changes based on our current state and level of spiritual awareness.  
**Explanation:** This idea highlights the fluidity and contextual nature of prayer. It suggests that prayer is not a one-size-fits-all experience; rather, it reflects the dynamics of our inner state (the Anthakarna) and our journey toward the Divine. Recognizing that "good prayer" evolves depending on our spiritual maturity allows for more inclusive expressions of devotion, allowing beginners to engage meaningfully with the Divine.  
**Connections:**  
- **Stages of Spiritual Development:** Similar to spiritual progression in various traditions, where practices adapt as the individual matures.  
- **Anthakarna:** The concept mirrors the internal faculties of consciousness in Hindu philosophy, encompassing mind, intellect, and memory.  
- **Meditation Practices:** Different forms of meditation cater to varied states of being; for instance, beginners may rely on verbal chanting before achieving mental stillness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Heart of Prayer:** By David A. Stout, which explores how prayer evolves across different stages of personal development.  
- **The Path of Meditation:** By Swami Veda Bharati, addressing meditation practices for beginners.  
- **In the Depths of the Heart:** By Henri Nouwen, examining the relational aspect of prayer and presence.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can we honor our current state of spiritual development while seeking to deepen our prayer practice?
