**Note 2: The Transience of Thoughts**  
**Title:** The Fleeting Nature of Thoughts  
**Quote:** "A thought has no power of belief. A thought cannot believe another thought."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Thoughts do not possess the ability to believe; one thought cannot validate or give weight to another thought.  
**Explanation:** This statement elucidates the ephemeral quality of thoughts, contrasting them with the enduring quality of Consciousness. Thoughts arise and dissolve rapidly, lacking the stable foundation necessary to wield true belief. This perspective encourages us to recognize that just because a thought crosses our mind, it doesn't hold inherent truth or authority over our beliefs and experiences. Understanding this dynamic can lead to greater mental clarity and reduce the impact of negative or unhelpful thoughts, as it removes their perceived power over our identity and emotional state. By discerning the transient nature of thoughts, we can cultivate a more profound sense of equanimity and purity in our Consciousness.
