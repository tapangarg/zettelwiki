**Note 2: The Nature of Peace in Self-Inquiry**  
**Title:** Discovering Peace Through Self-Inquiry  
**Quote:** "But when you do ask ‘Who am I?’ the by-product is that peace comes."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When you engage in the inquiry of ‘Who am I?’, one of the results is experiencing peace.  
**Explanation:** The statement emphasizes that the practice of self-inquiry naturally leads to a state of peace and stillness within. Asking profound questions about one's identity serves as a powerful tool for transcending superficial thoughts and conditions, allowing the seeker to connect with a deeper sense of being. This concept is significant because it highlights the relationship between inquiry, understanding oneself, and the inherent calmness that can arise from this process. It invites practitioners to embrace the challenge of exploring their identity as a pathway to inner tranquility.
