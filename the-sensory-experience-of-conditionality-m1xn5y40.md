**Note 2: The Sensation of Tightness as a Reflection of Ego**  
**Title:** The Sensory Experience of Conditionality  
**Quote:** "there’s always some kind of constriction, like a vibration that’s not rooted in an openness."  
**Translation into Modern English:** There frequently exists a feeling of constriction or tension, which stems from being closed off, rather than open to experience.  
**Explanation:** The dialogue suggests that the sensation of tightness experienced in the body often corresponds to the presence of an active ego or conditioned belief system. This constriction could manifest as anxiety, stress, or discomfort, indicating that we are resisting openness or vulnerability. Recognizing this tightness allows us to delve into the underlying beliefs that generate such sensations, enabling us to process and eventually release them. This practice promotes a greater sense of spaciousness and allows for natural openness, self-acceptance, and emotional healing.  
**Connections:**

- **Buddhist Teachings on Attachment:** Concepts of attachment leading to suffering echoing the predictions by Siddhartha Gautama.  
- **Trauma-Informed Approaches:** Understanding how past experiences may lead to constricted self-expressions and emotional responses.
