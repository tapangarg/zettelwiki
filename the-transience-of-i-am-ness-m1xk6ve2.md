**Note 2: The Illusory Nature of 'I Am'**  
**Title:** The Transience of 'I Am-ness'  
**Quote:** "Even this ‘I Am-ness’, this Being, is not aware of I."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Even the fundamental feeling of existence, the consciousness of 'I am,' is not capable of self-awareness.  
**Explanation:** This observation points to the paradox of existence: while we often identify with the 'I am,' this sense of being is still part of the flow of experience rather than the true essence of self. It implies that even our deepest understandings of selfhood—our awareness of being—are not the final arbiters of identity. The disconnection from the transient nature of this 'I Am-ness' offers a deeper reflection on the essence of reality, shifting our focus from identification with existence to understanding awareness as something more profound and permanent.  
**Connections:**  
- **Buddhist Philosophy:** The concept of Anatta (no-self) in Buddhism, which teaches that there is no permanent self or soul.  
- **Existentialism:** The exploration of existence and the inherent absurdity of life, questioning what it means to 'be.'  
- **The Perennial Philosophy:** Texts emphasizing the underlying unity of spiritual truths across different traditions can further illuminate these ideas.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Four Noble Truths** by the Dalai Lama, touching on the nature of suffering and self.  
- **Being and Time** by Martin Heidegger, which provides an existential exploration of being.  
- **The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching** by Thich Nhat Hanh, which offers insights into existence and self-concept.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How does the realization that 'I Am-ness' is not the ultimate identity affect your perception of self, and what implications does it have for your interactions in the world around you?
