**Note 2: The Nature of Thought and Emotion**  
**Title:** Letting Go of Thoughts and Emotional Attachments  
**Quote:** "How to deal with thought? Just let go. Divest them of your belief."  
**Translation into Modern English:** To navigate your thoughts, release them without clinging; detach your belief from them.  
**Explanation:** The advice to "let go" emphasizes the importance of not identifying with thoughts, recognizing them as transient occurrences rather than defining aspects of the self. This process encourages individuals to observe thoughts without judgment or attachment, fostering mental clarity and emotional freedom. By divesting beliefs from thoughts, one can view them as part of the mind's workings rather than personal truths. The same applies to emotionsâ€”by refusing to label emotions as "my emotion," individuals can develop an objective awareness of their emotional experiences without being overwhelmed by them. This promotes emotional resilience and insight, leading to a more balanced emotional life.

- **Non-Duality:** A philosophical perspective that asserts there is a fundamental unity to all things; recognizing this can aid in the let-go process.
