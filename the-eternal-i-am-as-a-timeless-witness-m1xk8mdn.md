**Note 2: The Nature of the Eternal Self**  
**Title:** The Eternal ‘I Am’ as a Timeless Witness  
**Quote:** "And it is this nameless and formless Witnessing... of this which comes and goes... which doesn’t go anywhere; which is timeless, which is eternal; un-hurt by anything."  
**Translation into Modern English:** The true essence of our being is the nameless and formless presence that observes everything. This presence is timeless and eternal, remaining unaffected by anything that occurs.  
**Explanation:** This passage suggests that the essence of one's being—often referred to as the Self or the Witness—is intrinsically unchanging and unaffected by the transient experiences of life. Unlike everything else that undergoes constant transformation (thoughts, emotions, experiences), this ‘I Am’ remains a constant presence. This realization is pivotal because it encourages individuals to detach from the changing aspects of existence and instead connect with the part of themselves that is eternal. The acknowledgment of this unchanging aspect can foster resilience and a sense of peace, as one learns to navigate life with the understanding that their true self is not defined by external circumstances.  
**Connections:**  
- **Non-Duality (Advaita Vedanta):** The philosophy emphasizing that individual self (Atman) and ultimate reality (Brahman) are one and the same.  
- **The Witness (Sakshi) Concept in Hindu Philosophy:** This refers to the observer aspect of consciousness that perceives but remains unaffected.  
- **Mindfulness Practices:** These activities cultivate awareness of the present moment and can help individuals connect to the unchanging nature of their internal witness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Power of Now** by Eckhart Tolle, which provides insights into the nature of consciousness and presence.  
- **I Am That** by Nisargadatta Maharaj, which offers profound truths about the nature of self and existence.  
- **The Untethered Soul** by Michael A. Singer, detailing the exploration of consciousness and the witness within.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways can cultivating an awareness of the eternal witness alter your perception of daily thoughts and experiences?
