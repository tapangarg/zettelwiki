**Note 1: The Hardening to Life's Beauty with Age**

**Title:** Becoming Hardened to Childhood's Freshness

**Quote:** "As we grow older and become worldly-wise and sophisticated, we become hardened to the beauty that life sets before us."

**Translation into Modern English:** As we age and acquire worldly experience, we lose the sensitivity to appreciate life's inherent beauty.

**Explanation:** The passage discusses a common human experience where the pressures and knowledge acquired with age can dull our ability to see and appreciate the beauty in life. The 'sophistication' and 'worldly wisdom' often lead to a loss of the innocence and openness of childhood, which once allowed us to embrace the world in a state of wonder and receptivity. The hurried pace of contemporary life exacerbates this, stripping away fresh perspectives and clouding our senses with burdens and distractions.

**Connections:** 
- **Mindfulness in Modern Living:** The practice of mindfulness focuses on reclaiming the ability to notice the small details in life.
- **Childlike Wonder:** Philosophical and psychological perspectives on maintaining a sense of wonder throughout one's life.
- **Impact of Urban Living:** How urban environments can both enhance and inhibit our connection with nature and beauty.

**Further Reading:**
- **"The Miracle of Mindfulness" by Thich Nhat Hanh:** A guide to achieving mindfulness and presence in everyday life.
- **"On Beauty and Being Just" by Elaine Scarry:** An exploration of the role and perception of beauty in human experience.
- **"Last Child in the Woods" by Richard Louv:** Discusses how children are losing connection with nature, which could relate to adult desensitization to beauty.

**Question for Contemplation:** How can we consciously cultivate a sense of appreciation for life's beauty as we grow older?

## Original Content

As we grow older and become worldly-wise and sophisticated, we become hardened to the beauty that life sets before us. The harried, hurried, pace of modern living beats out of us the freshness of childhood’s receptivity. One simple way to begin to recover this receptivity is by slowing down and pausing to look at the world around us. One day as William Wordsworth was crossing Westminster Bridge in London, a bridge that he had crossed countless times before, he stopped and looked at the city about him. He captured what he had experienced that morning in his poem “Composed Upon Westminster Bridge, Sept. 3, 1803.” Earth has not any thing to show more fair; 
Dull would be he of soul who could pass by 
A sight so touching in its majesty. 
This city now doth like a garment wear 
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare, 
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie 
Open unto the fields, and to the sky, 
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air. 
Never did sun more beautifully steep 
In his first splendour valley, rock, or hill; 
Ne’er say I, never felt, a calm so deep! 
The river glideth at his own sweet will; 
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep, 
And all that mighty heart is lying still!11
