**Note 1: The Concept of Presence**  
**Title:** The Essence of Being: The Experience of Presence  
**Quote:** “When you taste your own Presence, then you stop searching here and there. Your own Presence of Being. This is the Presence that wakes up.”  
**Translation into Modern English:** When you truly experience your own essence or being, you cease to seek fulfillment externally. This essence is what awakens to the truth of existence.  

**Explanation:** The speaker emphasizes the transformative experience of recognizing one’s own Presence or essence. This concept suggests that the search for meaning often occurs externally through distractions or desires, but an inner realization of one's true self leads to a profound satisfaction and understanding. It speaks to the idea of awakening—an unveiling of the self, where individuals can access deeper truths about their existence and purpose. This understanding is critical for personal growth and spiritual development as it involves moving away from conditional happiness found in external situations towards a more stable and enduring form of fulfillment inherent to self-awareness and acceptance.
