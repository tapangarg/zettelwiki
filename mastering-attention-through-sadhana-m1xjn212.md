**Note 1: Attention as the Anchor of Presence**  
**Title:** Mastering Attention Through Sadhana  
**Quote:** "when [Nisargadatta] Maharaj said ‘Stay. Give your attention only to the sense I Am’ he was referring to keeping the attention, giving an anchor to the attention, in the Presence."  
**Translation into Modern English:** When Nisargadatta Maharaj advised to "stay" and focus your attention solely on the sense of "I Am," he emphasized the importance of anchoring your attention in the present moment or the underlying awareness of being.  
**Explanation:** This note emphasizes the importance of attention in spiritual practices (or sadhanas) aimed at self-realization and presence. By directing attention to the sense of "I Am," practitioners are encouraged to stay grounded in their inherent awareness rather than become distracted by transient thoughts and external stimuli. This anchoring serves as a form of mindfulness, where the practitioner aims to cultivate a state of presence that transcends the fluctuations of the mind. This focusing effort lays the groundwork for deeper states of meditation and presence, ultimately fostering a more profound connection with one's true self.
