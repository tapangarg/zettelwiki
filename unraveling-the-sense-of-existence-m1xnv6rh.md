**Note 2: The Concept of 'I Am'**  
**Title:** Unraveling the Sense of Existence  
**Quote:** "As we come to a recognition of this 'I' which is without attributes, then even that which has the attribute ‘Am’... will reveal itself on its own."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Recognizing the unadorned 'I,' which exists beyond characteristics and labels, will allow the sense of existence, 'I Am,' to become apparent by itself.  
**Explanation:** This part of the text highlights the liberation that comes from recognizing the core self—the pure 'I' devoid of attributes or identities. By stripping away the external labels and societal conditioning, one may arrive at a fundamental understanding of existence itself. 'I Am' represents the active state of being, yet true realization lies in recognizing that the essence of 'I' exists before any identification with roles, thoughts, or experiences. This non-identity offers clarity and reveals the inherent awareness that permeates existence. It emphasizes that ultimately, self-realization is a natural unfolding that does not require force; it emerges through the recognition of the true self.  
**Connections:**  
- **Buddhist Non-Self (Anatta):** The concept that there is no permanent, unchanging self, encouraging liberation from attachment to identity.  
- **Zen Buddhism:** Often utilizes direct questioning and koans to point towards awakening and realization of the true self.  
- **The Concept of Consciousness in Philosophy:** Explores various interpretations of conscious experience and existence as fundamentally intertwined.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **The Wisdom of Insecurity:** By Alan Watts explores the need for certainty and the freedom found in embracing uncertainty and the present moment.  
- **Be Here Now:** By Ram Dass emphasizes presence and awareness to connect with the eternal self beyond ego.  
- **A Course in Miracles:** This text offers a framework for understanding the nature of reality, self, and the divine.  
**Question for Contemplation:** In what ways does the awareness of being without attributes allow us to transcend personal limitations and embrace the true essence of our existence?
