**Note 3: The Nature of Existence and Inquiry**  
**Title:** Understanding the Nature of Existence through Inquiry  
**Quote:** "Who is the one that wants peace? That is really the inquiry, isn’t it?"  
**Translation into Modern English:** The central question directing our inquiry should be about identifying the one who desires peace.  
**Explanation:** This quote draws attention to the essence of existential questioning. It urges us to direct our inquiry toward the root of our desires and the identity behind them. In traditional spiritual practices, questions often revolve around seeking outer fulfillment; however, a deeper inquiry explores the motivations driving those desires. By investigating who is behind the yearning for peace, we delve into the essence of our identity, questioning the truth of the self that seeks satisfaction. This exploration is significant because it shifts perception from a search for external contentment to an internal assessment of existence and identity, ultimately leading to liberation from suffering.  
**Connections:**  
- **Existential Philosophy and Identity:** Thinkers such as Soren Kierkegaard and Jean-Paul Sartre who interrogate existence and the self from various angles.  
- **The Nature of Desire in Spiritual Psychology:** How modern psychology interprets the concept of desire as a driver of human action and suffering.  
- **Self-Inquiry in Non-dual Traditions:** The process of questioning that allows individuals to peel back layers of thought to reveal deeper truths about themselves.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Existentialism is a Humanism** by Jean-Paul Sartre, which examines the nature of existence and the individual’s quest for meaning and identity.  
- **The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety** by Alan Watts, which addresses the nature of existence and the pursuit of security in an insecure world.  
- **The Book of Not Knowing** by Peter Ralston, which delves into inquiry and understanding of self through awareness practices.  
**Question for Contemplation:** Who is the 'I' that seeks peace and happiness, and how might understanding the motivations behind this desire change your approach to inquiry and existence?
