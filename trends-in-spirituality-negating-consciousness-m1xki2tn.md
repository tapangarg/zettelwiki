**Note 3: The Popular Trend of Negating Consciousness**  
**Title:** Trends in Spirituality: Negating Consciousness  
**Quote:** "It has become very popular to negate this Consciousness or Beingness."  
**Translation into Modern English:** There's a growing trend among spiritual seekers to overlook the significance of Consciousness or individual Beingness, often stating that all is ultimately Awareness.  
**Explanation:** The author points to a contemporary movement within spiritual circles that seeks to collapse the distinction between Awareness and Consciousness, suggesting that such distinctions may detract from the understanding that everything is ultimately Awareness. This perspective can be both liberating and limiting; while it aims at emphasizing oneness, it risks undermining the necessary recognition of personal Consciousness as an essential step on the spiritual path. Such negations can lead to confusion among seekers as they navigate the spiritual landscape, potentially causing them to bypass important personal transformations that can only occur through encountering and integrating their individuality before merging into the experience of universal Awareness.
