**Note 3: The Challenge of Recognizing Awareness**  
**Title:** The Difficulty of Experiencing Awareness Directly  
**Quote:** "Because we don’t see something phenomenally the mind comes and says, ‘I don’t know if I am aware or not’."  
**Translation into Modern English:** Our inability to perceive awareness as a distinct phenomenon prompts the mind to question its existence; we encounter uncertainty about whether we are truly aware.  
**Explanation:** This passage articulates a common challenge in developing a clear understanding of awareness. Unlike tangible sensations or emotions, awareness is not something that can be easily identified as a separate object within our experience. This leads to uncertainty and confusion regarding its existence—illustrating a fascinating paradox where the very nature of our awareness diminishes its visibility as if it hides in plain sight. The struggle to grasp awareness can hinder spiritual progress, as practitioners may second-guess their states of consciousness or self-awareness. Coming to terms with this paradox is essential for deepening one’s understanding of consciousness and honing one’s meditative or contemplative practices. It invites an exploration of how we might expand our ability to perceive this nebulous quality of awareness at deeper levels.  
**Connections:**  
- **Cognitive Dissonance in Consciousness:** The gap between our understanding and experience can create a sense of dissonance that is worth examining.  
- **Philosophy of Language:** The incapacity of language to encapsulate certain experiences, such as awareness, reflects philosophical ideas about the limitations of verbal comprehension.  
- **Spiritual Doubt:** Many spiritual traditions recognize doubt and confusion as natural components of personal growth on the path to understanding awareness.  
**Further Reading:**  
- **Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of a Mindful Life:** By Robert A. Emmons, which engages with the role of awareness in psychological well-being.  
- **The Conscious Universe: The Scientific Truth of Psychic Phenomena:** By Dean Radin, offers an exploration of consciousness and observation.  
- **Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion:** By Sam Harris, discusses the nature of consciousness and awareness from a secular standpoint.  
**Question for Contemplation:** How can we strengthen our connection to awareness amidst the confusion and distractions created by our minds?
